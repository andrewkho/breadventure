sweet potato rolls

pureed vegetables give a lovely moistness to bread and rolls . this simple recipe — inspired by one appearing in james beard 's classic `` beard on bread '' — calls for half a cup of pureed sweet potato , but you may also use yams , squash , pumpkin or mashed potato ( in which case you 'll lose the distinctive orange color ) . make these rolls for thanksgiving dinner , if you 'd like ; but they 're especially apropos the day after , when you 're faced with a tiny bit of leftover sweet potatoes , some squash , half a cup of mashed potato , etc . serve rolls with leftover turkey in gravy , or use them to make bite-sized sandwiches — the turkey version of white castle hamburgers .

18 g active dry yeast or 14 g instant yeast

106 g mashed sweet potato , yam , squash , pumpkin , or regular potato

in a large bowl , dissolve the yeast and sugar in the warm water . let sit for 10 minutes . while yeast is getting started , melt butter and let it cool . add cooled butter , salt , cinnamon , eggs , flour , and mashed vegetable to yeast mixture , stirring to blend ; dough will be quite slack . beat with the flat beater of an electric mixer , or stir by hand , for about 5 minutes . place dough in a well-greased bowl , turning to coat all sides , and cover with plastic wrap ; or scoop into a large , well-oiled plastic bag , sealing bag near the top . refrigerate dough 8 hours , or overnight . next day , remove dough from refrigerator , and place on a lightly floured surface . divide dough into 24 pieces , rolling each piece into a ball ; being cold , the dough will be quite easy to work with . if it it 's overly sticky , rub your hands with a bit of oil . place rolls in a lightly greased large , round pan — a 14 '' deep-dish pizza pan works well — or two lightly greased 9 '' or 10 '' cake pans . set aside to rise for about 3 hours , or until rolls fill the pan . bake rolls in a preheated 375°f oven for about 20 minutes , or until they 're lightly browned .

european-style hearth bread

these batards ( or italian-style loaves ) , featuring a crunchy crust and chewy interior marked by irregular holes , are a perfect accompaniment to any meal . they also make great sandwiches . the poolish ( or starter ) , made the night before , gives the bread its excellent texture and flavor ; while not difficult to make , this bread does take some time , so plan accordingly . like any loaf made without fat , these become stale very quickly . so bake and eat them the same day or , if they 're day-old , reheat them for 5 to 10 minutes in a preheated 350°f oven .

poolish

74 g cool water ( about 65°f )
60 g artisan bread flour
1/16 teaspoon ( a pinch ) instant yeast

dough

all of the poolish ( above )
170 g cool water , about 65°f
298 g artisan bread flour
1 teaspoon instant yeast
1 1/4 teaspoons salt

to make the poolish : combine the flour , water , and yeast . cover the container and allow to rest for 12 to 16 hours at room temperature . when the poolish is ready to use , it will be doubled in size , and filled with large bubbles . to make the dough : add the water to the poolish . add the flour , mix to combine , cover the bowl , and allow the mixture to rest for 20 minutes . this rest period ( autolyse , in french ) allows the flour to absorb the liquid and the gluten to start its development , making kneading easier and more effective . add the yeast and salt , and knead the dough until it 's fairly smooth , about 5 to 7 minutes by hand , 3 to 4 minutes by electric mixer , or 5 to 7 minutes in a bread machine . the gluten will continue to develop as the dough rises , so you do n't want to develop it fully during the kneading process . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl , cover the bowl , and allow the dough to rise , at room temperature , for 1 1/2 hours . to help develop the gluten , distribute the yeast 's food , and expel any excess carbon dioxide , turn the dough every 30 minutes during the rising time : gently fold all four sides into the middle , and turn the dough over . transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface , divide it in half , shape each half into a rough log , cover them , and let them rest for 15 to 20 minutes . this allows the gluten to relax , making it easier to shape the bread . shape the logs into batards ( shorter and fatter than traditional french baguettes ) or italian-style loaves — tapered ovals about 12 '' long . place the loaves on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet , cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap , and allow them to rise at room temperature for about 2 hours ; they should be puffy but not doubled . when the loaves are nearly done rising , preheat the oven to 425°f . using a sharp knife or razor , and holding it at a 10° to 20° angle , make four slashes in each loaf . these should be nearly vertical to the loaf , each about 1/3 the length of the loaf . the beginning of each cut will run parallel to the previous cut by 1/3 the length of the cut . spray the loaves with warm water . bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes , or until the loaves are a deep , golden brown . european-style loaves are generally baked longer than american loaves ; if you 're uncomfortable with a very dark crust , reduce the baking time a bit .

tips from our bakers

time : flavor comes from long , slow fermentation ( rising ) at relatively low temperatures . an ambient rising temperature of 70°f to 80°f results in the best-flavored bread . using a preferment ( variously known as a poolish , a biga , a sponge , or a levain ) helps develop even more flavor .
use more water : wetter is usually better . a slack ( wet ) dough allows for more active fermentation and complete development of the gluten structure . a hydration of 65 % or more based on total flour weight is a good place to start ; the hydration in the preceding recipe is about 68 % . ( consider the weight of the flour is 100 % , then divide the weight of the water by the weight of the flour to find the hydration level . for example , if your flour weighs 12 ounces , using 6 ounces of water would give you 50 % hydration . )
handle dough gently during shaping . forget all you 've heard about punching and slapping your dough . when you 're deflating dough at any point during its fermentation process , simply fold it over gently onto itself . and when you 're shaping , you do n't want to expel all the air ; just make sure the dough is smooth , without huge air pockets .


lemon sugar crunch buns

a light and airy sweet roll gets a crackly , crunchy topping of lemon sugar cookie dough before being baked to sweet perfection . each bun is unique and adds a quirky note of whimsy to your breakfast bread basket .

lemon dough

99 g sugar
43 g butter , very soft
2 tablespoons lemon powder or lemon zest
1/4 teaspoon baking powder
14 to 28 g cream or milk , as needed
1 large egg

prepare the sweet vanilla yeast dough by hand , machine or on the dough cycle of your bread machine . allow the dough to rise for 60 minutes or until full and puffy . divide the risen dough into 8 equal portions and shape into round buns . place on a parchment-lined baking sheet . set aside while you prepare the lemon crunch dough . preheat the oven to 350°f and combine the cake flour blend , sugar , butter , lemon powder ( or zest ) and baking powder in a small bowl until crumbly . add the egg and enough cream or milk to make a soft , sticky cookie dough . dip your fingers in cold water and scoop up about 2 tablespoons of the lemon dough . use your wet hands to mold it around one of the buns . the water will keep the dough from sticking to you , and help smooth out the lemon dough . if desired sprinkle the buns with coarse white sparking sugar . place the lemon dough coated buns on the baking sheet to rise , covered , for 25 to 30 minutes or until full and round . bake for 25 to 30 minutes or until the bottom edges of the buns just begin to turn brown . during the baking , the lemon dough will crinkle and crackle over the sweet dough . each will be unique . remove the buns form the oven and allow to cool for 15 minutes before serving . store the buns at room temperature in a plastic bread bag for up to 4 days . the crackle will soften over time , but is still delicious . yield : 8 large buns .

roasted vegetable focaccia

ever wonder what to do with all that zucchini from your garden ? roast it , then pair with other favorite roasted vegetables — scallions and tomatoes are tasty — and bake atop a pan of light-as-air focaccia . this is summer at its best .

starter

113 g cool water
1/16 teaspoon instant yeast
120 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour

dough

all of the starter ( above )
2 teaspoons instant yeast
113 g lukewarm water
241 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
11 g baker 's special dry milk or nonfat dry milk
25 g olive oil
* use 1 tablespoon less water in summer ( or in a humid environment ) , 1 tablespoon more in winter ( or in a dry climate ) .

topping

1361 g zuccchini , about 6 medium zucchini *
olive oil
pizza seasoning , optional
2 bunches scallions , root ends trimmed *
1 pound cherry tomatoes *
shaved parmesan cheese , optional
* do n't stress over exact amounts here ; more or less of any of these ingredients is fine .

to make the starter : mix the water and 1/16 teaspoon yeast , then add the flour , stirring until the flour is incorporated . the starter will be paste-like ; it wo n't form a ball . cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours ; the starter will be bubbly . if you make this in the late afternoon , it 'll be ready to go by the next morning . combine the risen starter with the remaining dough ingredients , and mix and knead — by hand , mixer , or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft , smooth dough . if you 're kneading in a stand mixer , it should take about 7 minutes at second speed . place the dough in a lightly greased container , cover , and let it rise for 1 hour . gently deflate the dough , and allow it to rise for another hour ; it should have doubled in bulk from its original volume . sometime during the dough 's rise , prepare the vegetables . trim the zucchini , and slice about 3/4 '' thick . toss with olive oil ; sprinkle with pizza seasoning ( or other dried herbs ) , if desired . spread the zucchini , in a single layer , on a lightly greased baking sheet . cut the cherry tomatoes in half . toss them with olive oil and pizza seasoning or dried herbs . place them , cut-side down , on a lightly greased baking sheet . cut the scallions into 2 '' to 3 '' pieces . toss in oil , sprinkle with herbs , and place on the baking sheet along with the tomatoes . place the vegetables in a preheated 400°f oven . bake the zucchini , turning it over once , until it 's golden brown . this will take about 60 minutes . bake the scallions and tomatoes until they 're starting to brown and soften , about 25 to 30 minutes . remove the vegetables from the oven , use a spatula to gently loosen them from the pan , and set them aside . lightly grease an 18 '' x 13 '' rimmed baking sheet ( half-sheet pan ) with non-stick vegetable oil spray . drizzle olive oil atop the spray ; the spray keeps the bread from sticking , while the olive oil gives the bottom crust great crunch and flavor . gently deflate the dough . pull and shape it into a rough rectangle , and pat it into the pan . as soon as it begins to fight you and shrink back , stop patting . wait 15 minutes ; pat the dough farther towards the edges of the pan . repeat once more , if necessary , until the dough is close to covering the bottom of the pan . place the zucchini atop the dough . cover the pan , and allow the dough to rise until it 's very puffy , almost billowy . this will take about 2 to 3 hours . toward the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 425°f . place the pan on a lower rack in your oven , and bake the focaccia for 15 minutes . remove the pan from the oven , top with the scallions and tomatoes , return to the oven , and bake for an additional 10 minutes , until the crust around the edges ( and showing between the vegetables ) is golden brown . remove the focaccia from the oven , and top with parmesan cheese , if desired . yield : one focaccia , 8 to 10 servings .




no-knead chewy sandwich rolls

submarines , grinders , hoagies , heroes , po ' boys ... what do you call a stuffed sandwich on a long roll ? whatever its regional name , there 's nothing like bellying up to the counter at the sandwich shop and ordering `` an italian cold cut and provolone with everything '' — everything ranging from chopped onions and tomatoes to chopped lettuce , hot peppers , oil and vinegar dressing , sweet peppers ... these are the typical new england choices , but surely you have your own regional variations . do i hear muffaletta ? these sandwich rolls , which start with a wet , sticky dough that 's never really kneaded , are n't crisp/crunchy like baguettes . while they feature the baguette 's open texture , they 're more chewy than crusty . in addition , they 're flattened off slightly on top , the better to hold a full load of filling . the no-knead method used in this recipe is native to france , where it 's used to make baguettes de tradition — we use it for some of the baguettes at our bakery .

mix all of the ingredients together in a bowl large enough that flour does n't spill over the sides , and large enough for the dough to rise once it 's mixed . once everything is roughly combined ( some floury patches will still be evident ) , take a dough scraper ( first choice ) or spatula and lift/fold the dough over on itself for 30 strokes . cover the bowl , and let the dough rest for 20 minutes . give the dough 30 more strokes . cover it , and let it rest for 20 minutes . repeat the process one more time . by the end of this 20-minute rest , you will have stirred the dough three separate times over the course of an hour . now , give it 30 more strokes ; see how it 's smoothed out , compared to when you first started ? cover the bowl , and let the dough rise for 2 hours in a fairly warm spot ; 75°f to 80°f is perfect . if you do n't have anywhere that warm , do n't stress ; just set the bowl somewhere away from cold drafts . after 2 hours , the dough will have risen , though not wildly . it 'll still be sticky and slack , but you should be able to work with it , so long as you grease or wet your hands . place the dough on a lightly greased or floured work surface . divide it into 5 pieces ; each will be about 176g , or 6 1/4 ounces . if you 're uneasy about trying to divide it into 5 pieces , just go ahead and divide it into 6 pieces , for slightly smaller rolls . gently push , prod , and pull each piece of dough into a log about 7 '' to 8 '' long . keep your hands wet or oiled to facilitate this process . this is n't a typically springy , elastic dough you can easily shape ; as noted , it 's more a matter of push/pulling it into shape . transfer the logs to a lightly greased or , preferably , parchment-lined pan , spacing them across the length of the pan . a half-sheet pan is the perfect size . cover the pan with a large plastic cover , or drape the loaves with heavily greased plastic wrap or parchment . let them rise until they 're noticeably puffy , 2 to 3 hours or so . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 475°f . uncover the rolls , and spritz them heavily with warm water . bake the rolls for 18 to 20 minutes , until they 're a dark golden brown . remove them from the oven , and transfer them to a rack to cool . store the cooled rolls in a paper bag for a day or so ; freeze for longer storage . yield : 5 large ( 8 '' ) rolls .




savory cheese biscotti

keep these in a jar on the counter for a savory ( rather than sweet ) after-work treat . they 're great to nibble on as you 're preparing supper .

57 g unsalted butter , softened
50 g vegetable shortening
25 g granulated sugar
32 g tomato paste
99 g grated parmesan cheese
1 to 2 teaspoons dried italian herbs
2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 large eggs
298 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
170 g pecans , walnuts , almonds , hazelnuts , pine nuts , or pistachio nuts , toasted ( see `` tips '' , below . )

preheat the oven to 375°f . lightly grease ( or line with parchment ) two baking sheets . in a large bowl , beat together the butter , shortening , sugar , tomato powder or paste , cheese , herbs , baking powder and salt until well-combined and fairly smooth . add the eggs one at a time , beating well after each addition and scraping down the bowl midway through . mix in the flour until you have a cohesive dough . add the nuts , mixing until they 're well-distributed throughout the dough . transfer the dough to a work surface ( we do n't bother to flour the surface ; the dough is sticky , but is easily scraped up with a bench knife or dough scraper ) . divide it into three fairly equal pieces , and shape each piece into a rough 10 '' log . transfer each log to the baking sheet , leaving about 3 '' between each log . wet your fingers , and pat the logs into smooth-topped rectangles 10 '' long x 2 1/2 '' wide x 7/8 '' thick . bake the logs for 20 to 25 minutes , or until they 're beginning to brown around the edges . remove them from the oven , and allow them to cool for 30 minutes . lower the oven temperature to 300°f . gently transfer the logs to a cutting surface , and use a serrated knife to cut them on the diagonal into 1/2 '' wide slices . because of the nuts and the nature of the dough , the biscotti at this point are prone to crumbling ; just be sure to use a slow , gentle sawing motion , and accept the fact that some bits and pieces will break off . carefully transfer the slices , cut sides up ( and down ) to a parchment-lined ( makes cleanup easier ) or ungreased baking sheet . you can crowd them together , as they wo n't expand further ; about 1/4 '' breathing space is all that 's required . return the biscotti to the 300°f oven , and bake them for 20 minutes . remove them from the oven , quickly turn them over , and bake for an additional 20 minutes , or until they 're very dry and beginning to brown . remove them from the oven , cool completely , and store in an airtight container .

tips from our bakers

pecans , walnuts , almonds and hazelnuts can be toasted . pistachios do n't need to be toasted . pine nuts — if you can afford to use them , they 're wonderful — toast very quickly , so reduce the oven time and keep a sharp eye on them.for the herbs , you can use a single herb or combination of rosemary , basil , parsley and/or oregano .

1 teaspoon vanilla extract or buttery sweet dough flavor

coconut sauce

113 g coconut milk powder
283 g water
99 g sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons cornstarch
pinch of salt

mix and knead the dough ingredients together by hand , mixer , or bread machine set on the dough cycle until you 've made a smooth dough . if you 're kneading in a stand mixer , it should take 5 to 7 minutes at second speed , and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl , perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom . in a bread machine ( or by hand ) , it should form a soft , smooth ball . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl . cover the bowl , and allow the dough to rise , at room temperature , until it 's nearly doubled in bulk , about 1 hour . rising may take longer , especially if you 've kneaded by hand . give it enough time to become quite puffy . while the dough is rising , grease a 9 '' x 13 '' pan . gently deflate the dough , and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface . divide it into 12 pieces . shape each piece into a rough ball by pulling the dough into a very small knot at the bottom , then rolling it under the palm of your hand into a smooth ball . place the rolls in the pan , spacing them evenly ; they wo n't touch one another . cover lightly with plastic wrap and set aside to rise , about 45 to 60 minutes . about halfway though the rise , preheat the oven to 350°f . during the last 20 minutes of rising , prepare the coconut sauce . combine all of the sauce ingredients in a small saucepan over medium-high heat . cook , stirring constantly , until thickened slightly , about 5 to 7 minutes . pour the warm , thick sauce over the risen buns and bake in the preheated oven for 18 to 25 minutes , until the buns are golden brown on top and the internal temperature registers 190°f on an instant-read thermometer . serve the warm buns from the pan , scooping up the thick sauce with a spoon . the coconut milk will form a thin , chewy , intensely coconut skin on top of the buns . it 's nearly as addicting as the crisp skin on a holiday turkey . yield : 12 buns

tips from our bakers

want really big , buxom buns ? bake in a 9 '' x 9 '' square pan to make 9 larger buns . if you do n't have coconut milk powder , you can substitute 1 1/4 cups canned coconut milk for the water/coconut milk powder . cook as directed . coconut milk generally comes in a scant 14-ounce can , so you may not need the whole can . if your can is smaller , add enough water to equal 1 1/4 cups liquid .

71 g coarsely grated onion
2 cloves garlic , peeled and crushed
28-ounce can or 26-ounce aseptic box crushed tomatoes
1 teaspoon dried oregano ; or 1 teaspoon pizza seasoning

filling

1 pound mozzarella cheese , sliced
567 g frozen chopped spinach , thawed and squeezed dry , optional

topping

113 g grated parmesan , romano , aged asiago , or your favorite hard cheese
sliced pepperoni or anchovies , optional

to make the crust : combine the dry ingredients and the oils and butter , mixing till crumbs form . then add the water , and mix and knead — by hand , stand mixer , or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make an elastic , fairly stiff dough . place in a large , greased bowl ; cover , and let rise at room temperature for 1 hour . for best flavor , after its initial 1-hour rise , refrigerate the dough for several hours , or for up to 24 hours . you can use the crust after its first 1-hour rise , but its flavor will improve with the longer , slower rise offered by refrigeration . to make the sausage , combine all the ingredients . refrigerate overnight , for best flavor . to make the sauce : sauté the coarsely grated onion in the butter till it 's beginning to color . add the crushed garlic , and sauté for about 30 seconds . stir in the tomatoes , oregano , sugar , and salt , and simmer gently for up to 1 hour , to concentrate the flavors . to assemble the pizza : divide the dough into two pieces . one should be about three-quarters of the dough ; the other , one-quarter . if you have a scale , one piece should weigh about 36 ounces ; the other , about 13 ounces . divide each piece of dough in half again . butter the bottom and sides of two 9 '' x 2 '' -deep round cake pans , then drizzle olive oil in the bottom of each . stretch , then roll one of the larger pieces of dough into a round large enough ( about 15 '' to 16 '' ) to line the bottom and sides of one pan , with some overhang . do the same with one of the smaller pieces of dough , rolling it to about 9 '' to 10 '' . cover the pieces of dough , and go away for 15 minutes . this will relax the dough 's gluten , allowing you to handle it without it shrinking . once the first two pieces of dough are rolled and resting , repeat with the other two pieces , covering them till you 're ready to use them . after 15 minutes , place one of the larger pieces of dough in the pan , pressing it gently into the corners ; you 'll have some overhang . spread half the uncooked sausage over the crust , gently patting it flat . top with half the sliced mozzarella . spread with half the spinach , or any additional filling of your choice . place the smaller piece of dough atop the filling . fold over the overhanging edges of dough , and squeeze/crimp to seal . poke holes all over the top crust , to allow steam to escape . repeat with the remaining dough and ingredients , making another 9 '' round pizza . preheat the oven to 425°f ( with your pizza stone on a lower shelf , if you 're using a stone ) . while the oven preheats , allow the pizza ( s ) to rest/rise , covered , for about 30 minutes . just before baking , top the pizzas with the sauce , and sprinkle with the grated cheese . bake the pizzas till the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly , 20 to 25 minutes . remove the pizzas from the oven , and allow them to set for about 15 minutes . loosen their edges , and gently turn them out of the pan onto a rack to cool . to do this , place a round cooling rack atop one pan , and turn the whole thing over . lift off the pan , place a rack on the bottom of the pizza , and turn the whole thing over again , so the pizza is now right side up . serve warm , with a fork . use a pair of scissors or baker 's bench knife to cut wedges . yield : two 9 '' deep-dish pizzas , about 16 servings .

tips from our bakers

want to substitute all-purpose flour for semolina ? go for it ; reduce the water by a tablespoon or two.do n't care for sausage or spinach ? stuff the pizza with whatever you like . just make sure the ingredients are cooked , so that they do n't exude juice into the crust . four cups of sliced white button mushrooms , sautéed and cooled , are a nice addition ; as is a combination of canned artichoke hearts and sliced black olives , both well-drained .

banana bran bread

banana breads are often one of the first recipes a beginning baker tries . they have so much going for them : they 're reasonably healthy , they 're fast , they 're usually moist , and the softer your bananas , the better they are . banana breads make good friends with add-ins , too , like coconut , chocolate chips , nuts , and bran . this loaf is baked in an 8 1/2 '' x 4 '' pan instead of a more typical 9 x 5 '' quickbread pan . using the smaller pan gives a taller loaf .

50 g vegetable oil or canola oil
60 g bran cereal ( not bran flakes )

multigrain rolls

these rolls pack a wide variety of whole grains . but do n't worry , you wo n't have to buy a dozen different bags of flour for multigrain goodness . our whole-grain flour blend combines nine whole grains for an easy and convenient shortcut to these soft , moist , slightly sweet rolls .

255 g lukewarm water
85 g molasses
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
57 g butter , softened
18 g golden flax meal
14 g wheat germ
21 g quick-cooking oats
170 g king arthur whole grain flour blend
241 g king arthur unbleached bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

mix and then knead all of the ingredients — by hand , mixer , or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft , smooth dough ; adjust its consistency with additional flour or water as needed . cover the dough , and allow it to rise for 60 to 90 minutes , or until it 's somewhat puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk . gently deflate the dough , and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface . divide the dough into 8 equal pieces , and round each piece into a smooth ball . lightly grease a 9 '' round pan — we like our stoneware bun pan — and space the rolls evenly in the pan . cover the pan , and allow the rolls to rise until they 're crowded against one another and quite puffy , about 60 to 90 minutes . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 350°f . bake the rolls for 28 to 30 minutes , until they 're golden brown on top and the edge of the center roll springs back lightly when you touch it . a digital thermometer inserted into the middle of the center roll should register at least 190°f . remove the rolls from the oven , and brush with melted butter , if desired . after a couple of minutes , turn the rolls out of the pan onto a rack to cool . store well-wrapped at room temperature for several days ; freeze for longer storage .

lemon-cherry buns

mardi gras happens at the end of february , and for christians it marks the final day of `` rich '' living before lent , a period of deprivation . hot cross buns , traditionally served at the end of lent , can also mark its beginning . our take on these soft , rich buns with their distinctive icing cross leaves out the usual dried peel and spices , substituting the bright , fresh tastes of lemon and cherry — just the ticket for the final cold days of february ! tender and buttery , with a crisp , golden crust , these buns are distinctly and assertively lemon , but not sweet : the icing is a wonderful counterpoint to the bun itself .

dough

283 g lukewarm milk
113 g butter , soft
1 large egg plus 1 large egg yolk ( save the extra white for glaze )
1/4 teaspoon lemon oil or 1 tablespoon lemon zest
2 teaspoons salt

85 g citron , optional

glaze

1 large egg white
28 g water

icing

85 g white chocolate
113 g confectioners ' sugar
21 g light corn syrup
14 g hot water

combine all of the dough ingredients — by hand , mixer , or bread machine — and knead the dough until it 's smooth , soft and supple ; avoid adding too much flour , as this will make the buns tough and dry . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl , cover the bowl with plastic wrap , and allow the dough to rise for about 1 1/2 hours , or until it 's puffy , though it may not have doubled in bulk . if using a bread machine , let it rise in the bucket for an additional 30 minutes instead . transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface , and divide it into 20 pieces . allow the pieces to rest , covered , for 10 minutes . lightly grease a 14 '' round pan ; a 12 x 12 '' pan ; or two 9 '' round cake pans . round the dough into balls , and place them in the prepared pans . cover the pans , and allow the buns to rise for about 1 hour , or until they 're nice and puffy and have filled the pan . while the buns are rising , whisk together the glaze ingredients , and set aside . preheat your oven to 375°f . brush the buns lightly with the glaze . bake them for 30 to 35 minutes , or until they 're golden brown . while the buns are baking , make the icing . while the buns are baking , make the icing . melt the white chocolate over low heat or in the microwave . stir in the remaining ingredients until smooth . the icing should be thicker than honey , but still `` flow . '' add an extra tablespoon of hot water if the icing is too thick . while the buns are still warm , pipe the icing in a thick cross shape atop each bun . use a pastry bag with 1/4 '' round or flat tip , or put the icing into a plastic bag , snip off the end , and squeeze it out . store , covered , for 3 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to a month .

starter

113 g ripe ( fed ) sourdough starter
113 g water
113 g king arthur white whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon instant yeast or active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar

batter

all of the starter
170 g buttermilk , at room temperature
43 g honey
60 g king arthur unbleached bread flour
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
28 g oat bran
1 tablespoon golden flax meal
32 g hi-maize fiber
semolina or farina for sprinkling

for the starter : combine the starter ingredients , mix well , cover and let rest at room temperature for at least 4 hours , and as long as overnight . when it 's ready to be used , it will be risen and bubbly . combine the buttermilk and honey and add to the starter . whisk together the flour , salt , baking soda , oat bran , milled flax , and hi-maize , and stir into the batter . when mixed , it will be thick but not quite pourable . let the batter sit while you set up and preheat the griddle to 325°f . grease 8 english muffin rings and place them on the griddle . sprinkle the griddle and inside of the rings with semolina or farina . using a muffin scoop , dollop 1/4 cup of batter into each ring , using your greased fingers to tease it out to the edges . bake for 10 to 15 minutes , until bubbles come up to the surface and the edges look dry . sprinkle the tops of the muffins with more semolina or farina , and flip them over . to check for doneness , run a small knife or metal spatula around the inside of the ring ; use tongs to remove the rings from the muffins . now you can poke the muffins from the side with an instant-read thermometer . when the centers are between 195°f and 200°f , the muffins are done . remove from the griddle , split , and toast to serve . yield : 8 english muffins .

tips from our bakers

what 's `` active '' sourdough starter ? if it 's been fed within the last 4 days , it 's likely in good enough shape to be used right from your refrigerator . it should be homogenous ( not separated with liquid on top ) , and have visible bubbles . if your starter has separated , discard half , mix the rest with equal parts of flour and water by weight , and let it work on the counter for 4 or more hours ( until you see it bubbling slowly ) , before measuring out what you need to make the recipe.what 's the sprinkle all about ? sprinkling the griddle and the tops of the muffins with semolina or farina creates a slight gap underneath the batter as it 's baking , which moderates the temperature and keeps the muffins from burning . we like the texture of semolina 's finer grind better than that of cornmeal , which can be gritty when cooked .

128 g chopped dark chocolate
113 g unsalted butter
28 g unsweetened cocoa powder , dutch-process or natural
57 g confectioners ' sugar

glaze

74 g water
135 g granulated sugar

to make the dough : use your fingers to rub together the sugar and lemon zest until all of the sugar is moistened . combine the lemon sugar with the flour and yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the beater blade . mix on low speed to combine , about 1 minute . add the eggs , water , and salt , and mix on low speed briefly . increase to medium speed and mix for 5 minutes , until the dough comes together ( it will appear very dry and shaggy at first ; that ’ s ok ) . switch to the dough hook . add the butter a few cubes at a time , kneading until each cube is completely incorporated into the dough . continue kneading on medium speed for about 10 minutes , until the dough is completely smooth , elastic , and shiny . place the dough in a large greased bowl , turning to coat it , and cover with plastic wrap . refrigerate overnight . to make the filling : place the chocolate , butter , and cocoa powder into a medium heat-proof bowl and microwave in 30-second increments until the chocolate is completely melted , stirring after each ( it will take around 2 minutes ) . add the confectioners ’ sugar , mixing until thoroughly incorporated . set aside to thicken , about 30 minutes ; the mixture should be malleable , the consistency of soft ganache . to assemble the babka : divide the dough in half . working with one piece at a time , roll the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 15 ” x 11 ” rectangle . use an offset spatula to spread half the chocolate mixture over the dough , leaving a 1/2 ” border around the edges . brush a little bit of water along the long edge of the rectangle farthest away from you . starting from the long side closest to you , roll the dough into a log . press to seal the dampened end , then use both hands to even out the roll . rest the log on its seam . trim about 3/4 ” off each end of the roll using a serrated knife . using the same knife , gently cut the roll in half lengthwise , starting at the top and finishing at the seam underneath . with the cut sides facing up , gently alternate crossing the pieces over each other to create a two-strand braid . repeat with the second piece of dough and remaining chocolate filling . line a large baking sheet with parchment paper . gently transfer the two babka braids to the prepared pan and shape them into one large circle , braiding together the ends for continuity . cover with lightly greased plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours ; the babka won ’ t double in size , but will rise by about 20 percent . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 375°f . remove the plastic wrap . bake the babka for 25 to 30 minutes , until a skewer inserted into the center of the dough comes out clean and all of the exposed chocolate swirls are firm to the touch . while the babka is baking , make the glaze . combine the water and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat . when the sugar is fully dissolved , remove from the heat and set aside . as soon as the babka comes out of the oven , brush all of the glaze over the babka ; it will seem like a lot , but just keep brushing ! slide the parchment paper from the baking pan to a cooling rack . allow the babka to cool completely before serving . store any leftovers , well wrapped in plastic , at room temperature for up to 3 days ; freeze for up to a month .

place the ingredients into the pan of your machine , in the order suggested by the manufacturer ; program for french bread , or a similar long-rising cycle ; and press start . check the dough after about 10 minutes of kneading ; add additional water or flour as necessary to make a smooth , soft dough . remove the bread from the machine when it 's done , and cool it on a rack .

tips from our bakers

because everyone 's sourdough starter will vary in consistency — some are on the stiff side , some on the soft — we give a range for the amount of water to add . start with the smaller amount of water then add more , if necessary , to make a smooth , soft dough.for crustier bread , substitute water for the vegetable oil.this recipe was developed using the french bread cycle on an early-model zojirushi . this particular cycle called for a total of 30 minutes of kneading , a first rise of 40 minutes , and a second rise of 1 hour , 50 minutes . it 's this long second rise that allows the sourdough to attain sufficient volume . the bread bakes for 60 minutes , slightly longer than the usual 55 minutes . your machine may have a whole-grain or some other cycle that approximates these kneading and rising times . or , if you have a machine that 's programmable ( zojirushi virtuoso or supreme ) , you can easily program these cycle times in yourself via the homemade menu .

227 g ripe ( fed ) sourdough starter
340 g lukewarm water
1 to 2 teaspoons instant yeast *
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
602 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
* see `` tips , '' below .

combine all of the ingredients , kneading to form a smooth dough . allow the dough to rise , in a lightly greased , covered bowl , until it 's doubled in size , about 90 minutes . gently divide the dough in half ; it 'll deflate somewhat . gently shape the dough into two oval loaves ; or , for longer loaves , two 10 '' to 11 '' logs . place the loaves on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet . cover and let rise until very puffy , about 1 hour . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 425°f . spray the loaves with lukewarm water . make two fairly deep diagonal slashes in each ; a serrated bread knife , wielded firmly , works well here . bake the bread for 25 to 30 minutes , until it 's a very deep golden brown . remove it from the oven , and cool on a rack .

tips from our bakers

why the range in yeast amount ? if you 're sure your starter is healthy and vigorous , and you do n't mind potentially extending somewhat the rise times listed above , use 1 teaspoon yeast . if your starter seems a bit lethargic ( or you want to keep your rise times on the shorter side ) , go with 2 teaspoons . for an assertively sour loaf , read our recipe for extra-tangy sourdough bread . want a brick oven effect ? rather than dividing the dough into two separate loaves , shape it into one large ball , and place it in the base of a round covered stoneware baker , such as la cloche . put the lid on , and let the loaf rise for 1 hour . make two slashes on top of the bread , and bake for 30 to 35 minutes , removing the lid of the baker for the final 5 minutes of baking .

the flour/liquid ratio is important in this recipe . if you measure flour by sprinkling it into your measuring cup , then gently sweeping off the excess , use 7 3/4 cups . if you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister , then sweeping off the excess , use 6 3/4 cups . most accurate of all , and guaranteed to give you the best results , if you measure flour by weight , use 33 ounces . to make the dough : combine all of the dough ingredients , in the order written , in a very large bowl ( at least 6 quarts ) . stir to make a sticky dough . you can do this in a stand mixer and then transfer to a larger bowl ; or simply use a big bowl and spoon ( or dough whisk ) . cover the bowl , and let the dough rise for 2 hours at cool room temperature . refrigerate the dough for at least several hours , to chill it and make it easier to work with . it can be refrigerated for up to 4 days before using . when you 're ready to make challah , remove the dough from the refrigerator , and scoop out about one-third of the dough ( about 21 ounces ) . transfer it to a floured work surface ; a silicone mat works well here . divide the dough into three pieces , and shape each piece into a log about 24 '' long . braid the logs , pinching the strands together at each end . lightly grease an 8 '' x 2 '' round cake pan . it 's important that the pan is at least 2 '' deep . if it 's not use , a 9 '' round pan . coil the braid into the pan . cover the pan , and allow the braid to rise for about 90 minutes , till it 's quite puffy . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 350°f . uncover the challah , and brush it with the egg/water mixture . sprinkle with seeds , if desired . bake the challah for 30 to 35 minutes , till it 's golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers at least 190°f . remove from the oven , and carefully turn out of the pan onto a rack to cool . yield : one 9 '' round braid . the entire recipe will make 3 loaves .

tips from our bakers

for a braid with a bigger hole in the center , coil the dough into a 9 '' round pan , rather than an 8 '' pan .


( insert your name here ) 's stuffed buns

the french have their pain au chocolat , a soft , brioche-type bread ( or , alternatively , croissant ) wrapped around specially shaped , slim bars of chocolate . us ? we 've got stuffed buns — soft , `` squishy white bread '' dough wrapped around ... well , chocolate truffles , or chocolate cherry cordials , a hershey 's kiss or part of a chunky bar . or none of the above . use whatever chocolates you happen to have around . out of 16 buns , only two leaked — one chocolate-cherry cordial , and one fudge truffle . the lesson being , be extra careful in shaping and sealing these buns around their chocolate centers . you want to keep all of that molten chocolate inside the baked bun , not spilling into the bottom of the pan .

361 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
32 g sugar
25 g bakers ' special dry milk or nonfat dry milk
32 g potato flour or potato flakes
57 g butter
2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
255 g lukewarm water

filling

16 pieces of chocolate , or other candy

combine all of the ingredients — by hand , electric mixer , or bread machine — and mix and knead until you 've made a smooth , soft dough . place the dough in a bowl , and allow it to rise , covered , for 60 to 90 minutes . it 's a very slow riser , so do n't expect anything spectacular . lightly grease a 12 '' x 12 '' sticky bun pan , or a 9 '' x 13 '' pan . gently deflate the dough , and divide it into 16 pieces . let the pieces rest , covered , for about 10 minutes , while you survey and decide upon your fillings . whatever you select should be about the size of one of those 25¢ gumballs you get out of a machine . the wrapped lindt truffles are the ideal size . working with one piece of dough at a time , flatten it slightly , just enough to be able to wrap it around whatever size chocolate ( or other candy ) you 've selected . place the candy in the center , and bring the edges up around it , sealing them very tightly and thoroughly . place the ball of dough , seam-side down , on an unfloured , very lightly greased work surface . cup your fingers over it ( like you 're grabbing a softball ) and , using the palm of your hand , roll it in a quick circular motion . this rounds the ball up nicely , and also helps finish the seal on the bottom . place the bun in the pan . repeat with the remaining dough balls . cover the pan , and allow the buns to rise for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours at room temperature . by that time , they should be getting close to touching , but probably wo n't be touching yet . toward the end of the rise , preheat the oven to 350°f . bake the buns for 18 to 20 minutes , until they 're golden brown , but still show some white down towards their bottoms . you do n't want to over-bake these , or they 'll be dry and tough . remove them from the oven , and brush them with additional melted butter , if desired . transfer them to a rack to cool , allowing them at least 10 minutes , for the chocolate to set , before breaking one open . store the buns , well-wrapped , at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to a month .

tips from our bakers

if you do n't have any chocolates ( or do n't want to donate them to this particular cause ) , make buttery cinnamon knots . roll each piece of dough into a 12 '' log , and tie it in a simple knot . bake the knots as directed above . brush the hot knots with butter , and sprinkle heavily with cinnamon-sugar ( or not ) .

tips from our bakers

* make your own blend
many of our gluten-free recipes use our king arthur gluten-free multi-purpose flour , which includes ingredients that reduce the grittiness sometimes found in gluten-free baked goods . our flour also increases the shelf life of your treats , keeping them fresh longer .


the following make-at-home blend , featuring stabilized brown rice flour , works pretty well when substituted ; and it tastes better than a blend using regular brown rice flour .


whisk together 6 cups ( 28 1/2 ounces ) king arthur stabilized brown rice flour ; 2 cups ( 10 3/4 ounces ) potato starch ; and 1 cup ( 4 ounces ) tapioca flour or tapioca starch . store airtight at room temperature . note : you can substitute white rice flour for the brown rice flour if you like ; it 'll make your baked goods grittier ( unless you manage to find a finely ground version ) .
it 's often difficult to be sure gluten-free quick breads are fully baked in the middle . a cake tester inserted into the center may come out crumb and batter free before the bread is fully baked ; thus , using an instant-read thermometer is a good idea .

these little savory gems are simple to put together in advance , can go directly from the freezer into the oven , and combine three of the most irresistible snack foods on earth : bread , cheese , and bacon . you can vary the filling in any number of ways ( see our tips , below ) . make sure you let the bites sit for 5 minutes before serving ; the cream cheese gets mighty hot , and you do n't want to burn anyone 's mouth .

12 ounces cream cheese , at room temperature
32 g grated parmesan cheese
92 g roasted red pepper , diced
53 g scallions , sliced , white and green
20 slices soft white bread
1 pound lean bacon

mix together the cheeses until smooth . stir in the peppers and scallions until evenly distributed ; set aside . trim the crusts from the slices of bread . once the bread is trimmed , spread the slices with the filling , covering it completely . roll the bread up from the short side , pressing down just enough to make it stick to itself . wrap a slice of bacon and wrap it around the roll , overlapping the bacon to cover the bread completely . if you need more than one bacon slice , tuck the end of the second bacon slice under the end of the first . trim the bacon when you get to the top of the roll . freeze the wrapped rolls for 30 minutes to firm them up . to bake , preheat the oven to 350°f . lightly grease a baking sheet , or line it with parchment paper . slice the rolls in thirds and place on the baking sheet , cut side down . bake for 30 to 35 minutes ( 5 minutes longer if baking from frozen ) , until the bacon is crisp and the tops are golden brown . remove from the oven and place on a serving platter ; let cool for 5 minutes before serving .

tips from our bakers

you can freeze the bacon-wrapped rolls for up to 6 weeks ; just take out what you need when you have company , slice , and bake for an extra 5 minutes.some variations you might like to try ? substitute swiss cheese for the parmesan , add 1 to 2 tablespoons of horseradish to the filling .
try using diced cooked shrimp and pineapple bits instead of the peppers and scallions . read our bakers ' banter blog entry about bacon bites for a lower fat , lower calorie version of these morsels .

no-knead crusty white bread

the most basic of all no-knead loaves , this is a wonderful way to get into yeast-bread baking . the easy stir-together dough rests in your refrigerator , developing flavor all the time , till you 're ready to bake . about 90 minutes before you want to serve bread , grab a handful of dough , shape it , let it rise , then bake for 30 minutes . the result ? incredible , crusty artisan-style bread . if you 're a first-time bread-baker , you 'll never believe this bread came out of your own oven . and even if you 're a seasoned bread baker , you 'll love this recipe 's simplicity .

680 g lukewarm water
907 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour * or organic all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt
14 g instant or active dry yeast
* see `` tips '' , below

combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl , or a large ( 6-quart ) , food-safe plastic bucket . for first-timers , `` lukewarm '' means about 105°f , but do n't stress over getting the temperatures exact here . comfortably warm is fine ; `` ouch , that 's hot ! '' is not . yeast is a living thing ; treat it nicely . mix and stir everything together to make a very sticky , rough dough . if you have a stand mixer , beat at medium speed with the beater blade for 30 to 60 seconds . if you do n't have a mixer , just stir-stir-stir with a big spoon or dough whisk until everything is combined . next , you 're going to let the dough rise . if you 've made the dough in a plastic bucket , you 're all set — just let it stay there , covering the bucket with a lid or plastic wrap ; a shower cap actually works well here . if you 've made the dough in a bowl that 's not at least 6-quart capacity , transfer it to a large bowl ; it 's going to rise a lot . there 's no need to grease the bowl , though you can if you like ; it makes it a bit easier to get the dough out when it 's time to bake bread . cover the bowl or bucket , and let the dough rise at room temperature for 2 hours . then refrigerate it for at least 2 hours , or for up to about 7 days . ( if you 're pressed for time , skip the room-temperature rise , and stick it right into the fridge ) . the longer you keep it in the fridge , the tangier it 'll get ; if you chill it for 7 days , it will taste like sourdough . over the course of the first day or so , it 'll rise , then fall . that 's ok ; that 's what it 's supposed to do . when you 're ready to make bread , sprinkle the top of the dough with flour ; this will make it easier to grab a hunk . grease your hands , and pull off about 1/4 to 1/3 of the dough — a 14-ounce to 19-ounce piece , if you have a scale . it 'll be about the size of a softball , or a large grapefruit . plop the sticky dough onto a floured work surface , and round it into a ball , or a longer log . do n't fuss around trying to make it perfect ; just do the best you can . place the loaf on a piece of parchment ( if you 're going to use a baking stone ) ; or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet . sift a light coating of flour over the top ; this will help keep the bread moist as it rests before baking . let the loaf warm to room temperature and rise ; this should take about 60 minutes ( or longer , up to a couple of hours , if your house is cool ) . it wo n't appear to rise upwards that much ; rather , it 'll seem to settle and expand . preheat your oven to 450°f while the loaf rests . if you 're using a baking stone , position it on a middle rack while the oven preheats . place a shallow metal or cast iron pan ( not glass , pyrex , or ceramic ) on the lowest oven rack , and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go . when you 're ready to bake , take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times , making a cut about 1/2 '' deep . the bread may deflate a bit ; that 's ok , it 'll pick right up in the hot oven . place the bread in the oven — onto the baking stone , if you 're using one , or simply onto a middle rack , if it 's on a pan — and carefully pour the 1 cup hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath . it 'll bubble and steam ; close the oven door quickly . bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes , until it 's a deep , golden brown . remove the bread from the oven , and cool it on a rack . store leftover bread in a plastic bag at room temperature .

tips from our bakers

the flour/liquid ratio is important in this recipe . if you measure flour by sprinkling it into your measuring cup , then gently sweeping off the excess , use 7 1/2 cups . if you measure flour by dipping your cup into the canister , then sweeping off the excess , use 6 1/2 cups . most accurate of all ( and guaranteed to give you the best results ) , if you measure flour by weight , use 32 ounces . using the same ratio/measuring , you can make a half-recipe if you prefer . while it 's great to have dough on hand , it 's fine to make less . want to try this with whole wheat flour ? you can absolutely make up to half of the total flour whole wheat , either our premium or white whole wheat flours . add an additional 2 teaspoons water per cup of whole wheat flour to prevent the dough from being too dry . would it be better to use bread flour here ? bread flour has more gluten-forming protein , so if you choose to use it in this recipe , the crust will be a bit thicker and you wo n't get quite the same open-holed structure as with all-purpose . we really prefer the texture of both crust and crumb when all-purpose flour is used . if you do use bread flour , increase the water by about 2 teaspoons per cup of flour to make the requisite sticky dough.want to cut this recipe in half ? go right ahead ; simply reduce each ingredient by 50 % , including the yeast , and proceed as directed.for super-crusty artisan-style bread , try baking your dough in a dutch oven . see the details in our blog post : bread baking in a dutch oven : the best way to bake no-knead bread . our thanks to jeff hertzberg and zoë françois , whose wonderful book , `` artisan bread in five minutes a day , '' is the inspiration for this recipe .

1 large egg beaten with a pinch of salt until well-combined

topping

57 g melted butter
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
74 g confectioners ' sugar
57 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour

combine all of the dough ingredients ( starting with the lesser amount of water ) , mixing until everything is moistened . add additional water if necessary to enable the dough to come together . cover the bowl , and let the dough rest for 20 minutes . then mix/knead it until it 's soft and smooth . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl , and cover the bowl . the dough is going to rise for about 1 1/2 to 2 hours , until it 's quite puffy . gently deflate the dough , and divide it in half . set the pieces aside , covered , while you make the filling . to make the filling : combine the sugar , cinnamon , cocoa , and espresso . stir in the melted butter . the mixture will look grainy and slick ; that 's ok . shape each half of the dough into a 9 '' x 18 '' , 1/4 '' -thick rectangle . if the dough `` fights back , '' let it rest for 10 minutes to relax the gluten , then stretch it some more . do n't be fussy about this ; 19 '' or 20 '' is as good as 18 '' . smear each piece of the dough with half the filling , coming to within an inch of the edges . scatter half the nuts , and half the chopped chocolate/chips over each piece . if using standard-size chips , process them in a food processor first , to create smaller bits of chocolate and a less chunky filling . starting with a short end , roll each piece gently into a log , sealing the seam and ends . working with one log at a time , use a pair of scissors or a sharp knife to cut the log in half lengthwise ( not crosswise ) to make two pieces of dough about 10 '' long each ; cut carefully , to prevent too much filling from spilling out . with the exposed filling side up , twist the two pieces into a braid , tucking the ends underneath . repeat with the other log . place each log into a lightly greased 9 '' x 5 '' loaf pan . brush each loaf with the egg glaze . mix together the topping ingredients until crumbly , and sprinkle half the topping over each loaf . tent each pan with plastic wrap , and let the loaves rise until they 're very puffy and have crowned a good inch over the rim of the pan , 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours . towards the end of the rising time , preheat your oven to 300°f . bake the bread for 35 minutes . tent lightly with foil , and bake for an additional 15 to 25 minutes ( for a total of 50 to 60 minutes ) ; the loaves should be a deep-golden brown . to ensure the loaves are baked through , insert a digital thermometer into the center of one loaf . it should register at least 190°f . remove the loaves from the oven , and immediately loosen the edges with a heatproof spatula or table knife . let the loaves cool for 10 minutes , then turn them out of the pans onto a rack to cool completely . slice the babka and serve it at room temperature ; or rewarm individual slices briefly in a toaster , if desired . store any leftovers , well wrapped , at room temperature for several days ; freeze for longer storage .

283 g lukewarm water
25 g olive oil or vegetable oil
85 g honey or 78 g maple syrup
397 g king arthur white whole wheat flour , premium whole wheat flour , or organic whole wheat flour
35 g sunflower , sesame or flax seeds , or a combination , optional
1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten , optional ; for higher rise
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

to make bread in a bread machine : put all of the ingredients into the bread pan in the order listed . program for basic white bread ( or for whole wheat bread , if your machine has a whole wheat setting ) , and press start . remove the bread from the machine when it 's done . either turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool ; or turn it out of the pan , place it back in the machine ( atop the structure that holds the pan ) , crack the lid open about 1 '' , and let it cool right in the cooling-down machine . this helps prevent the crust from wrinkling as the loaf cools . to make bread by hand : mix all of the ingredients in a large bowl , or in the bowl of a stand mixer . knead the dough until it 's smooth and just slightly tacky , about 8 to 10 minutes . place the dough in a greased bowl , cover , and let it rise until doubled in volume , about 1 to 1 1/2 hours . gently deflate the dough and shape it to fit a greased 8 1/2 '' x 4 1/2 '' loaf pan . let it rise , covered , until doubled , about 1 to 1 1/2 hours . bake the bread in a preheated 375°f oven for 35 minutes , or until a digital thermometer inserted in the center of the loaf reads 190°f . remove the bread from the oven , remove it from the pan , and cool it on a rack .

tips from our bakers

it should n't be hard adapting this loaf to your own bread machine ; all you need to know is what proportion of flour/liquid/yeast your machine functions best with . take a look at the dough after it 's kneaded for about 10 to 12 minutes or so ; it should be smooth , not sticky ( too little flour ) or lumpy ( too little liquid ) , forming a nice ball . if the dough looks good at this point , you 're probably all set .


hefekranz

this mildly sweet yeast bread , fashioned into a pretty braided wreath , is a lovely way to celebrate christmas . native to switzerland , it 's typically scented with lemon and studded with golden raisins . if you 're not a fan of raisins feel free to leave them out ( or substitute another dried fruit ) ; but we do like the interest and added flavor fruit offers .

2 large eggs
340 g lukewarm water
50 g sugar
1 tablespoon active dry yeast or instant yeast
71 g baker 's special dry milk or nonfat dry milk
602 g to 723 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour

1 large egg beaten with 14 g water , to glaze
sliced almonds , for garnish

in a large bowl , combine the eggs , water , sugar , yeast , dry milk , and 3 cups of the flour . let the mixture rest for 15 to 20 minutes ; this gives the yeast a chance to get going . add the salt , butter , lemon rind , raisins and 2 more cups of the flour , stirring until the dough begins to pull away from the sides of the bowl . knead the mixture , adding enough additional flour to make a soft , smooth dough . if you 're kneading by hand , this will take about 10 to 15 minutes . if you 're using an electric mixer , about 7 minutes at medium speed is sufficient . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl , cover it , and let it rise for about 1 hour , or until it 's noticeably puffy . gently deflate the dough , turn it over , and let it rise for an additional hour . transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface , and divide it into three pieces . shape each piece into a rough log ; then roll each log to make long ropes , about 34 '' long . the dough will want to shrink ; when this happens , simply let it rest for 10 minutes , covered , then roll it some more . braid the ropes together gently and form a circle by weaving the two ends together as well as you can . place the wreath on a large , well-greased baking sheet and let it rise , lightly covered , for 45 minutes to an hour , until it 's noticeably puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk . just before you place it in your oven , brush the surface of the wreath with the egg and water , and sprinkle on a generous handful of sliced almonds . place the wreath in a cold oven , set the temperature to 400° , and turn the oven on . fifteen minutes after you turn the oven on , reduce the heat to 350°f and bake for a further 25 to 30 minutes , until the loaf is golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers at least 190°f . remove the wreath from the oven , and transfer it to a rack to cool . store at room temperature , well wrapped , for several days ; freeze for longer storage .

tips from our bakers

for added interest , place candied cherries atop the wreath after baking ; just nestle them into the bread 's folds while it 's still warm from the oven . once the wreath is cool , drizzle it with a simple sugar glaze : 1/2 cup confectioners ' sugar mixed with 1/2 teaspoon vanilla , a pinch of salt , and up to 1 tablespoon water , enough to make a pourable glaze .

sandwich rye bread

this easy-to-slice rye bread ( no crumbling ! ) is perfect for sandwiches : pastrami , corned beef , a reuben , or just plain grilled swiss . it also makes tasty toast , a nice accompaniment to scrambled eggs . its secret ingredient is dill pickle juice , which gives the bread delightful tang and contributes to its moist texture . our guarantee : this bread will be moist , fine-grained , and easy to slice , with assertive flavor typical of rye bread : caraway and a touch of sharp mustard , with a mildly sour tang . it 's not a high-riser , but should be about 4 '' to 4 1/2 '' tall at the center when done .

2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast or active dry yeast
152 to 198 g lukewarm water *
50 g vegetable oil
170 g dill pickle juice
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/4 teaspoons caraway seeds
1 1/4 teaspoons dill seeds
1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds or 1 tablespoon prepared dijon mustard
46 g instant mashed potato flakes or potato flour
298 g king arthur unbleached bread flour
138 g pumpernickel
* use the lesser amount in summer ( or in a humid environment ) , the greater amount in winter ( or in a dry climate ) , and somewhere in between the rest of the year , or if your house is climate controlled .

combine all of the dough ingredients , and mix until clumps form ; the dough may seem dry at this point . let it rest for 20 minutes , for the flour to start to absorb the liquid . knead the doughby mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycleto make a stiff , but fairly smooth dough . it 'll take about 7 minutes in a stand mixer at second speed , using the dough hook . the dough should clean the sides of the bowl ; if it does n't sprinkle in a bit more all-purpose flour . we do n't recommend kneading this dough by hand , as it 's hard to develop the gluten sufficiently . if you do knead by hand , realize that the dough will take longer to rise , and wo n't rise as high . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl , cover the bowl , and let the dough rise till it 's puffy , about 1 to 2 hours . it may or may not have doubled in bulk , but it definitely will have expanded . gently deflate the dough , and shape it into a log . place the log in a lightly greased 8 1/2 '' x 4 1/2 '' loaf pan ( for a stiffer dough ) , or 9 '' x 5 '' loaf pan ( for a slacker dough ) . press it to the edges of the pan , and flatten the top . tent the pan with greased plastic wrap , and allow the loaf to rise till it 's crowned about 1 '' to 1 1/2 '' over the edge of the pan , about 1 to 1 1/2 hours . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 350°f . bake the bread for 20 minutes . tent it lightly with foil , and bake for an additional 20 minutes . when done the bread will be golden brown , and its internal temperature will register 190°f on an instant-read thermometer . remove the bread from the oven , wait 5 minutes , remove it from the pan , and allow it to cool completely on a rack before slicing . store for up to a week at cool room temperature .

tips from our bakers

homemade rye bread can be quite a challenge ; if you 're a beginning bread baker , please become familiar with the bread-baking process by trying a simpler loaf ( like our white sandwich bread ) before tackling this one.substitute white or medium rye flour for the pumpernickel , if desired . this bread has a sensitive liquid-flour ratio . the finished dough should be smooth and easy to handle ; it should n't be sticky . if it 's sticky , understand that the rising times may be shorter ; a slacker ( stickier ) dough usually rises faster than one that 's stiffer.we 've baked this successfully in both an 8 1/2 '' x 4 1/2 '' loaf pan , and a 9 '' x 5 '' loaf pan . if your dough is at all sticky , we recommend using the larger size pan . for a wonderfully close-grained , square-corner sandwich loaf , press the dough into a 9 '' x 4 '' pain de mie pan . bake the loaf as directed , removing the cover and tenting loosely with foil for the final 15 minutes of baking.this is a great place to use your `` discard '' sourdough starter . substitute up to 8 ounces starter for an equal weight of bread flour/water ; e.g. , substitute 6 ounces starter for 3 ounces water and 3 ounces bread flour . the starter will give the bread subtle tang .

baker 's croissants

a croissant de boulanger is a baker 's croissant , made from puff pastry dough that includes yeast . the dough is laminated ( folded around a slab of butter , then rolled out and folded to create hundreds of layers ) , cut , shaped , and proofed before baking . the result is an amazing pastry that can be filled with sweet ( chocolate , almond , cinnamon ) or savory ( ham and cheese , spinach ) flavors . with the addition of some spices ( see the tips section ) , this dough can be used to make danish as well .

dough

2 large eggs plus enough warm water to make 2 cups of liquid ( 16 ounces )
50 g sugar
631 g to 723 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
71 g baker 's special dry milk or nonfat dry milk ( optional )
1 scant tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon vanilla extract ( optional ; for sweet pastry )
28 g butter , melted

butter

425 g unsalted butter , cool to the touch
3/4 teaspoon salt ( omit if using salted butter )
60 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour

to make the dough : make a sponge by cracking the eggs into a 2-cup liquid measure and adding enough warm water to equal 2 cups . beat until blended , and pour into a large mixing bowl . you can also put the sponge into the bucket of your bread machine , set on the dough cycle . add 1 tablespoon of the sugar , 3 cups of the flour , and the yeast . mix until well blended . cover and set aside . to prepare the butter : while the yeast begins its work , set up the butter inlay . mix the butter and 1/2 cup flour just until the mixture is smooth and well blended ( no hard lumps ) . you can do this with a mixer , a food processor , or with a spoon , by hand . be careful not to beat the mixture at high speed ; you do n't want to incorporate any air . lightly flour a piece of plastic wrap , place the butter mixture on it , and use a dough scraper to pat it into an 8-inch square . wrap the butter and put it in the refrigerator on a flat surface for at least 30 minutes . to finish the dough : stir the vanilla , if using , and the melted butter into the sponge . whisk together the remaining 2 1/2 cups of the remaining flour , the rest of the sugar , the dry milk , and the salt . add to the sponge and mix until you have a soft but kneadable dough , either by hand , in your mixer , or using the dough cycle of your bread machine . check the dough after kneading for 4 to 5 minutes , adding more of the measured flour if the dough is still sticky . once the dough is smooth and elastic , pat it into a square shape , wrap it loosely and refrigerate it for 30 minutes . to laminate the dough : remove the chilled dough from the refrigerator and put it on a lightly floured surface . gently roll it into a square about 12 '' across . unwrap the butter slab and place it in the center of the dough at a 45° angle , so it looks like a diamond in the square . fold the flaps of the dough over the edges of the butter until they meet in the middle . pinch and seal the edges of the dough together ; moisten your fingers with a little water , if necessary . dust the top with flour , then turn the dough over and tap it gently with the rolling pin into a rectangular shape . pick up the dough to make sure it is n't sticking underneath , dusting under with more flour if necessary , then roll from the center out until you have a rectangle 20 '' long by 10 '' wide . when you 've reached the proper size , take a dry brush and lightly sweep off any excess flour , then fold the bottom third of the dough up to the center , and the top third over that ( like a business letter ) . line the edges up on top of each other , and even up the corners so they 're directly on top of each other . take a dab of water if you need to , to tack the corners together . you 've now made your first `` turn . '' rotate dough package 90° to the right , so it looks like a book ready to be opened . do another “ turn ” the same way : rotate , roll into a 20 '' x 10 '' rectangle , sweep off excess flour , and fold . return dough to refrigerator for at least 30 minutes . repeat above — rotating , rolling and folding — two more times , for a total of four turns . once completed , wrap dough well and refrigerate it for at least an hour , and preferably overnight , before using . to shape the croissants : using half the dough at a time , roll it to a 12 '' x 18 '' rectangle . trim the edges of the dough on every edge using a ruler and pizza wheel . this cuts off the folded edges that would inhibit the `` puff . '' cut the dough in thirds lengthwise and in half through the middle . this will give you six 4 '' x 9 '' pieces . cut each piece in half diagonally , and arrange them so the points of the triangles are facing away from you . it 's okay to stretch them out gently to elongate them when you do this . cut a 1/2 '' notch on the short side of the triangle . if you want to , this is the time to place a teaspoon of filling at the base of the triangle . roll up the dough , starting with the notched edge and working toward the point . make sure the point is tucked under the bottom of the croissant . if you have to stretch the dough a little to make that happen , it 's ok. you can also use a drop of water on the tip to help it stay in place . form the crescent by bending the ends toward the center where the tip is tucked underneath . place the croissants on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet . cover and chill for 30 minutes . you could also freeze the unbaked pastries at this point . to bake the croissants : take the croissants out of the refrigerator , and let them warm and rise for 60 to 90 minutes at room temperature . they should expand noticeably , and when you gently press one with your finger , the indentation should remain . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 425°f . when the oven is hot , brush the tops of the croissants with an egg well-beaten with 1 tablespoon of water , and put them into the oven . bake the croissants for 15 minutes , then reduce the oven 's temperature to 350°f and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes . the croissants should be a deep golden brown , even where the dough overlaps ; you do n't want any raw dough in the center . remove from the oven and cool on a rack .

tips from our bakers

adding flour to the butter inlay helps to stabilize it , so the butter wo n't flow out the seams of the dough as it 's being rolled.bubbles and leaks : it 's not unusual to have air trapped inside your laminated dough . if this happens , simply pop the bubble with a toothpick and press the dough down to lie flat . if there 's a bare spot where butter is coming through , dust the leak with flour , pressing down lightly so it sticks , and continue on with the fold . refrigerate the dough as soon as the fold is done , to firm it up.as you work , keep the dough , work surface , and your rolling pin well dusted with flour . turn over the dough from time to time . as you roll , you tend to expand the top layers more than the bottom . by flipping the dough over , you 'll even that out . before folding the dough over on itself , use your pastry brush to sweep off excess flour . this will help the dough stick to itself after folding , so the layers do n't slide around.have a little water on hand ; do n't be afraid to brush the corners of the dough with it , to tack the dough in place . you can make rectangular , filled croissants , too . see our blog for step by step instructions on how to do this . fill croissants with ham and cheese , spinach , or use our pain au chocolate sticks for a special treat.when rolling the dough , especially for the first time , be sure the dough and butter are at the same consistency ; this will make rolling much smoother and the layers will be more even.to make danish from this dough , add 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom , 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg , and 1/8 teaspoon of ground cloves to the dough when mixing . proceed with the rest of the recipe as shown until the dough is finished .

1 to 3 tablespoons taco seasoning or 1 tablespoon mild chili powder
filling add-ins ( see `` tips '' , below . )

to make the dough : combine all of the dough ingredients — by hand , mixer , or bread machine — kneading to form a soft , supple dough . transfer the dough to a greased bowl , cover it , and let it rise for 1 1/2 hours , or until it 's puffy . to make the filling : combine the filling ingredients , along with any desired add-ins . to combine : preheat the oven to 350°f . grease a 9 '' round cake pan . roll the dough into a long , 8 '' x 24 '' rectangle . spread it with 1 1/2 to 2 cups of the filling , leaving a 1 '' margin along the edges . fold in the two short ends , and roll the dough into a 24 '' log . pinch the dough to seal it well . keeping the seam side down , ease the log , in a loose spiral , into the prepared cake pan . pat the spiral down so it 's flat and even across the top . cover the dough and let it rise until it 's even with the top of the pan or slightly crowned above the lip of the pan , 1 1/2 to 2 hours . bake the bread for 45 to 50 minutes , until golden brown . serve warm , hot or cold , with a salad , if desired . store for 5 days well-wrapped at room temperature , or 3 months frozen .

tips from our bakers

optional filling add-ins include 1/2 cup diced raw onion , 1/4 cup salsa , 1/2 cup cooked and drained ground beef , sliced black olives , diced jalapeño peppers , or chopped fresh cilantro . if you use more than three of the preceding options , you 'll probably have leftover filling ( which is delicious served in taco shells or burritos ) . the filling should be firm , and should total around 2 cups altogether .

detmold sourdough bread

breads , yeast , sour , yeastfree

1 x no ingredients

preparation of starter , first evening

it is best to make a new starter with every batch of bread . to 1/2 tsp
detmold powder , add 1 cup warm ( 85f ) water and approximately 1 cup of
flour , such that the mixture has the consistency of thick soup . cover
and keep in a warm place ( e.g . the oven with light on ) for 24 hours .
there should tehn be bubbles in the mixture and a dark coloured
liquid should have separated .


preparation of starter , second evening % % % % %


add the starter mixture to 8 cups of warm water and optionally cooked
sweet rice ( see below ) . add sufficient flour to give the consistency
of thick soup . cover and let sit overnight in a warm place . the
sponge can be made from water and flour only , but a much sweeter
bread results from using a significant amount of cooked sweet rice .
twoo cups of dry sweet rice can be cooked in 8 cups of water and
allowed to cool for the sweet rice ingredient mentioned above .

preparation of dough , next morning

the sponge has now risen , and 1 cup of this could be saved for
subsequent starter if kept refrigerated and used within a few days .
however , even in the refrigerator , the mixture will soon acquire wild
yeasts and no longer be completely yeast-free . add to the risen
starter more flour until it becomes a kneadable dough . this will
require 12-18 cups of whole wheat flour . knead the dough as little
as possible . form the dough into loaves ( about 5 ) and place into well
oiled pans . ordinary bread pans do work , but the bread tends to be
thick crusted and to dry quickly . round cans such as coffee cans , or
48 oz juice cans give a bread that rises better and dries less
quickly . cover the pans with aluminum foil and let them sit in a
warm place for at least 4 hours .

baking bread , afternoon

place the loaves in a cold oven and turn the oven to 350f . bake for
about 1-1/2 hours total oven time . freeze the bread if it is not
going to be used within the next few days . it is best to use freezer
bags with the air drawn out , and double sealed .

consistency of yogurt and a curd has formed . ( you can test the
mixture by tilting the container . if the mixture does n't flow freely
when the container is tilted , it 's ready . ) the curding process takes
about 18 to 24 hours . you 'll need to check it periodically . if some
clear liquid rises to the top of the milk , stir it back in . note : if
the liquid turns pink , discard the batch and start again . once the
curd has formed , add the flour and stir until smooth . cover again and
let stand in a warm place until the mixture is full of bubbles and
has a good sour smell . this should take about 2 to 5 days . again , if
some clear liquid rises to the top stir it back in . if the liquid
turns pink , discard the batch and start again . when the mixture is
ready , you can keep it covered and store it in the refrigerator until
you need it . the recipe makes about

cake doughnuts ( crocker )

breads , crockpot

1 vegetable oil
3 1/3 cup all-purpose flour*
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon shortening
3 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 eggs

heat oil ( 2 to 3 inches ) in deep fryer or dutch oven to 375f beat 1.5
cups of the flour and the remaining ingredients in 1.5-quart bowl on
low speed , scraping bowl constantly , 30 seconds . beat on medium
speed , scraping bowl occasionally , 2 minutes . stir in remaining flour .

turn the dough onto generously floured cloth-covered board ; roll
around lightly to coat with flour . gently roll 3/8 inch thick cut
with floured doughnut cutter . slide doughnuts into hot oil with wide
spatula . turn doughnuts as they rise to surface . fry until golden
brown , 1 to 1.5 minutes on each side . remove carefully from oil ( do
not prick surfaces ) ; drain . serve plain or shake one at a time in a
bag with powdered sugar . 2 dozen doughnuts ; 150 calories per doughnut .

*if using self rising flour ; omit babng powder and salt .

buttermilk doughnuts : do not use self rising flour . substitute
buttermilk for the milk . decrease baking powder to 2 ts and beat in 1
ts baking soda .

note : hot fat cools somewhat when foods are dropped into it . while
foods are frying , temperature of fat should be 370f to 380f . if fat
is too hot , foods brown before they are cooked through ; if too cool ,
foods become grease-soaked . a deep-fat thermometer is a good
investment ; checking it helps maintain a constant temperature . do not
use a candy thermometer for deep-fat fiying as it does not register
high enough .

2 '' thickness for a pan pizza . brush the dough generously with olive
oil . thick crust : lightly oil a ( 14 '' ) pizza pan . sprinkle some
cornmeal onto the pan . form the dough into a pie using the pan . place
the sauce ( s ) and topping ( s ) on the dough , leaving the outer 1/2 ''
bare . remove the pie from the pizza pan . use a paddle to place the

the pan , pressing it down into the bottom and up the sides of the
pan . add the sauce ( s ) , seasoning ( s ) and topping ( s ) , leaving the
outermost 1/2 '' bare place in the preheated oven . both : bake until the
cheese is bubbly and the crust is golden . use a paddle to remove the

1/4 teaspoon ground masticha
1/2 cup butter ; melted
1 egg ; for glazing
1 blanched split almonds

new year bread is traditionally cut at midnight on new year 's eve .
after baking , a coin is inserted through a slit in the base . the
person who finds the coin will have luck in the new year . long ago
the coin used to be a gold one , then later a silver coin was used .
these could be incorporated into the dough before baking . nowadays
because of the nickel content of coins it is undesirable to bake a
coin in the cake .

dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the milk . add remainder of milk , eggs ,
orange rind and sugar . sift 3 cups flour , salt and spice into a warm
bowl and make a well in the centre . pour in yeast mixture and stir to
blend in flour , gradually adding warm melted butter . mix dough with
hands until it comes away from sides . turn on to a floured surface
and knead until smooth and elastic , adding remaining flour as
required . knead for 10 minutes . place ball of dough in a clean bowl
brushed with melted butter . turn dough over to coat top with butter
and cover bowl with a cloth or plastic wrap . leav to prove ( rise ) in
a warm place until doubled in bulk . punch down and turn on to lightly
floured surface . knead lightly and shape into a round loaf . place on
a large greased baking sheet or in a greased 25 cm ( 10 inch ) deep
cake tin . cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled - about 1
1/2 to 2 hours .

glaze with well-beaten egg and arrange blanched almonds in numbers to
denote the new year , pressing in lightly . bake in a moderately hot
oven for 45 minutes until golden brown and cooked when tested . if
bread browns too quickly place a piece of greased brown paper on top .
cool on a wire rack .

here 's a bagel recipe # 2

breads

1 x no ingredients

once the dough has risen , turn it onto your work surface , punch it
down , and divide immediately into as many hunks as you want to make
bagels . for this recipe , you will probably end up with about 15
bagels , so you will divide the dough into 15 roughly even-sized
hunks . begin forming the bagels . there are two schools of thought on
this . one method of bagel formation involves shaping the dough into a
rough sphere , then poking a hole through the middle with a finger and
then pulling at the dough around the hole to make the bagel . this is
the hole-centric method . the dough-centric method involves making a
long cylindrical `` snake '' of dough and wrapping it around your hand
into a loop and mashing the ends together . whatever you like to do is
fine . do not , however , give in to the temptation of using a doughnut
or cookie cutter to shape your bagels . this will pusht them out of
the realm of jewish bagel authenticity and give them a distinctly
protestant air . the bagels will not be perfectly shaped . they will
not be symmetrical . this is normal . this is okay . enjoy the
diversity . just like snowflakes , no two genuine bagels are exactly
alike .

begin to preheat the oven to 400 degrees farenheit .

once the bagels are formed , let them sit for about 10 minutes . they
will begin to rise slightly . ideally , they will rise by about
one-fourth volume ... a technique called `` half-proofing '' the dough . at
the end of the half-proofing , drop the bagels into the simmering
water one by one . you do n't want to crowd them , and so there should
only be two or three bagels simmering at any given time . the bagels
should sink first , then gracefully float to the top of the simmering
water . if they float , it 's not a big deal , but it does mean that
you 'll have a somewhat more bready ( and less bagely ) texture . let
the bagel simmer for about three minutes , then turn them over with a
skimmer or a slotted spoon . simmer another three minutes , and then
lift the bagels out of the water and set them on a clean kitchen
towel that has been spread on the countertop for this purpose . the
bagels should be pretty and shiny , thanks to the malt syrup or sugar
in the boiling water .

once all the bagels have been boiled , prepare your baking sheets by
sprinkling them with cornmeal . then arrange the bagels on the
prepared baking sheets and put them in the oven . let them bake for
about 25 mintues , then remove from the oven , turn them over and put
them back in the oven to finish baking for about ten minutes more .
this will help to prevent flat-bottomed bagels .

remove from the oven and cool on wire racks , or on a dry clean towels
if you have no racks . do not attempt to cut them until they are
cool ... hot bagels slice abominably and you 'll end up with a wadded
mass of bagel pulp . do n't do it .

serve with good cream cheese .

to customize bagels : after boiling but before baking , brush the
bagels with a wash made of 1 egg white and 3 tablespoons ice water
beaten together . sprinkle with the topping of your choice : poppy ,
sesame , or caraway seeds , toasted onion or raw garlic bits , salt or
whatever you like . just remember that bagels are essentially a savory
baked good , not a sweet one , and so things like fruit and sweet
spices are really rather out of place . submitted by

sourdough french bread

breads , sourdough

1 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup milk ( any type , but i prefer whole ; milk )
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon shortening
2 1/2 cup flour

combine milk , sugar , salt and shortening in a pan . heat until shortening
melts , then cool to lukewarm ( about 110 degrees f. ) .

stir milk into starter . add flour gradually , forming dough that pulls away
from sides of the bowl . knead until smooth ( about 15 minutes ) , adding
flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the board . when done ,
the dough will be fairly heavy , but smooth in texture .

place in a well-greased bowl and raise in a warm place until doubled . form
into a long loaf ( about 16 inches long ) . place on a greased baking sheet
and let rise again , until almost doubled .

cut diagonal slits in top of loaf with a sharp knife and bake in a 400
degree oven until done , about 30-35 min . remove from pan and let cool in a
draft-free location .

notes :

* an old-fashioned sourdough french bread -- this is a hearty bread ,
possibly heavier than many people are used to . the flavor is wonderfully
tangy and complements just about any meal . try it with garlic butter !

this bread is slow raising . i usually spend two days on it , start the
dough one day , let it rise overnight , then form the loaf and bake the next
day . this recipe is from `` the complete sourdough cookbook , '' by don and
myrtle holm .

* be careful that the milk mixture has cooled before adding it to the
starter . if it 's too hot , you 'll kill the starter and the bread wo n't
rise .

* since the dough rises for a long time , i usually cover it with a damp
towel to keep it from drying out .

* if you want a chewy crust , brush the top of the loaf with a mixture of
corn starch and water before baking . also , placing a pan of water in the
oven while baking will make the crust a little softer . i usually brush the
loaf with butter after baking .

: difficulty : moderate .
: time : 1 hour preparation , long rising time , 1/2 hour baking .

1/4 teaspoon sugar
1 egg white , beaten to a loose froth
1 cup whole milk

makes about 11 dozen 2 '' saltines from `` make your own groceries '' by
daphne metaxas hartwig .

use this dough to make a whole range of crackers - saltines ; oyster
crackers ; and big , round sea toast crackers .

kosher , sea , or table salt

melt the shortening and butter together ; let cool . sift 1 3/4 c of the
flour into a lg mixing bowl along with the baking powder , salt , and
sugar ; make a well in the center and pour in the shortening and
butter ; stir to combine , then stir in the egg white . add the milk
and beat vigorously to smooth out some of the lumps , then gradually
sift in enough flour to make a dough that will be stiff enough to
roll out . form the dough into a ball ; knead it for 10 min on a
floured surface until it is smooth and satiny . divide the dough into
2 equal balls , wrap each in wax paper and let them rest at room
temperature for 20 - 30 min .

on a floured surface , roll the first dough ball out as thinly as you
possibly can . cut the dough into 2 '' squares using a pizza cutter , a
ravioli wheel , or a very sharp , greased knife ; save the scraps . place
the dough squares just slightly apart from each other on ungreased
cookie sheet . sprinkle the squares with salt to taste and pat them
to embed the salt . prick each square several times with a fork . bake
in a preheated 375 f oven for 15 to 20 min until just slightly
browned . repeat for remaining dough ball and scraps .

sea toast

after the dough has rested , pinch off pieces about 1 1/2 to 2 '' round .
on a floured surface , roll each piece into the thinnest free-form
circle possible . place the circles on an ungreased cookie sheet ;
prick with a fork and bake at 375 f for about 15 min . very crispy
and perfect for cheese or soups . makes about 2 dozen .

oyster crackers

one rested dough ball at a time , roll the dough out as thinly as
possible ; transfer to a cookie sheet . cut the dough into diamond
shaped , 1 '' crackers with a ravioli wheel or a pizza cutter ; there is
no need to separate the crackers as the dough 's elasticity will do
the job . salt , embedded and gently prick the diamonds as previously
described . bake as directed for about 10 min .

nancy silverton 's grape starter

breads

2 cup bread flour
2 1/2 cup water
1/2 lb red grapes , stemmed

the grape starter is from julia child 's new master chef book ( $ 17.95
retail ) . it is a recipe given by nancy silverton . it takes 10 days to
complete but is then yours for life .

wrap the grapes in well washed cheesecloth , tieing the corners to
form a bag ; lightly crush them with a rolling pin ( to release the
sugar to mix with the natural yeast on the skins ; just like making
wine ! ) and immerse them in the flour water mix . cover tightly with a
lid or plastic wrap secured with a rubber band . leave at room
temperature for 6 days , stirring once or twice a day for the six days .

the bag of grapes will eventually appear inflated , and liquid will
begin to separate from the flour base . the mixture will begin to
taste and smell slightly fruity , and the color will be strange . that
is as it should be . by the sixth day the bag of grapes will have
deflated , the color will be yellow , and the taste pleasantly sour ;
the fermentation is complete . the starter is living but weak , and it
needs to be fed .

remove the grapes and squeeze their juices back into the starter .
stir it up thouroughly and transfer it to a clean container .
( although you can use it after just one feeding , the starter will be
stronger and healthier with the full treatment ) you can refrigerate
it until you 're ready to proceed .

three days before you plan to use it , stir 1 cup flour and 1 cup
water into the container , blending well . let stand uncovered at room
temperature until it bubbles up - 3 to 4 hours - then cover and
refrigerate . repeat this for the second and third day .

store the starter tightly covered in the refrigerator where it will
keep perfectly for 4 to 6 months.- after which it 's a good idea to
pour off all but 2 cups and give it another feeding . before using the
stored starter for bread , however , give it the full 3-day feeding
schedule once again to restore it and to tone down excess sourness .

this is the starter for the olive bread recipe which follows . from :

rahn salt-rising bread

breads

2 tablespoon corn meal
1/2 pint water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 quart milk
1 teaspoon salt
8 cup flour ( variable )

`` salt rising bread is leavened by the fermentation of flour and milk .
bacteria are most important actors in this play . the yeast plants of
the air find the batter a good stage for development . salt rising
bread needs more heat while fermenting and a much longer time to
bake . here is a good example : ''

stir 2 tbsp . of corn meal into 1/2 pint of water heated to 130 f. add
1/2 tsp . of salt and mix very well . put this in a jar or crock , cover
and place it in a pan of water at 160 f. keep overnight in a warm
place .

in the morning , warm 1 quart of milk ; add 1 tsp . salt and enough warm
flour to make a heavy batter . gradually add the overnight corn meal
and beat well for a few moments . cover and keep in a warm place
about 2 hours .

gradually add flour and beat mix until it becomes a very soft dough .
turn out on a floured board and knead until it is elastically smooth .
divide equally into four portions , mold into loaves , and place each
in a greased bread pan . cover with a clean cloth and keep in a warm
place for 1/2 hour . bake in a 350 f. oven for 1 hour .

sourdough starter

breads , sourdough

2 cup water , warm ( about 110 degrees f . )
2 1/2 cup flour
1 pkg yeast ( dry ) , active ( optional )

get a container for the starter . crockery is best , but just about anything
can be used , except metal . try to get something with a lid . i use a vinyl
plastic food-storage container .

mix flour and water ( and optionally yeast ) . let the starter sit ( uncovered
or loosely covered ) in a warm place until bubbly and sour , about 3-5 days .

if you do a lot of bread baking , there will probably be enough yeast spores
floating around your kitchen so that the added yeast is n't needed . the less
yeast you add to the starter , the more `` authentic '' the flavor .

if the starter starts turning orange or green , throw it away . other nasty
things have started growing in it !

after the starter is ready , it can be used immediately . try to use some of
the starter once every few days , or it will start to die . the starter can
be refrigerated to last longer ( use at least every other week ) . make sure
the starter is at room temperature before using .

after using some of the starter , replenish what you take with equal amounts
of warm water and flour . let the starter sit until nice and bubbly before
using again .

notes :

* starter culture for making sourdough bread -- many people think of
sourdough as something from the gold rush days . not so ! sourdough was the
first way raised breads were made . `` way back then , '' there was no such
thing as yeast ( dry ) , active , and all breads ( along with a number of other
goodies ) needed sourdough starter to rise .

there are a number of recipes for sourdough starter , but this is one i 've
used , and it works fairly well . it came originally from the cookbook `` the
complete sourdough cookbook '' by don holm .

* usually , the first starter made will need a while to `` come up to
strength . '' best bets for first recipes are ones that do n't require much
raising , such as pancakes , or ones that have additional yeast .

: difficulty : easy .
: time : 5 minutes preparation , 5 days waiting .
: precision : no need to measure .

1 white flour

another recipe from james beard 's book , `` beard on bread '' . about this
bread james beard says , `` i learned to make this bread in norway , at
mrs ovenstad 's farm near oslo . she bakes it twice a week , and though
she resorts to heating the dough over steam for the second rising , it
comes out beautifully . she is also a deft pastry cook and gardner ,
and loves to eat . ( 2 large loaves ) ''

about 1/2 cup at a time . you may need to add 3 more cups , give or
take a bit .

form into a ball , place into a greased bowl , turn and cover . allow to
rise until doubled in bulk , probably about 1 hour .

punch down and knead 10 minutes , then cut into two equal pieces , form
loaves , and allow to rise again .

you may elect to allow the bread to rise a second time in the bowl .
if so , james beard feels that the bread may need some help in the
second rising , in the form of a bit of heat . i am not so sure , as
this was a very willing bread dough . then again , i almost always
rise my bread in a microwave oven anyway .

as to baking , this bread requires about 1 hour in a 400 f. oven .

this bread should have a good crunchy crust .

i have made this loaf without the wheat berries , as the crust and
bread is delightful without the berries , and some members of the
family refer to soft berries as `` erasers '' and hard berries as `` rocks ''
~ refusing to eat bread with either . however , with a bit of
practice , you will be able to use the wheat berries at the right
point so they will be neither `` rocks '' or `` erasers '' .

masa sovada ( portuguese sweetbread )

breads

1/4 cup water ( warm for dry ; lukewarm for compressed )
1 cup scalded milk
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 teaspoon of salt
5 1/2 to 6 cups all-purpose flour
4 eggs
1 2 packages yeast ( active dry or com ; pressed )

preheat oven to 350 degrees .

dissolve yeast in warm water . scald milk and add to sugar , butter and
salt ; stir until butter is melted . mix cinnamon and flour . add 1/2 the
flour to the milk/sugar/butter/salt , and mix until smooth . beat 3
eggs and add them and the yeast to the mixture .

continue to add remaining flour to make soft dough . remove it from
the bowl and place on floured board . knead until smooth and satiny
( about 15 mins. ) . shape into a ball and place in buttered bowl . cover
and let rise until double in size ( 2-1/2 to 3 hours ) .

punch risen dough down and divide it in half . place in two greased
pans ( 8 inches round ) . let rise in warm place until double in size
( 1-1/2 to 2 hours ) . brush tops of dough with remaining egg ( beaten ) .

bake in 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown . cool
on wire racks .

notes : i have found that if i initially heat up the oven and then
turn it off , i put the dough in there to rise and it rises twice as
fast .

also , i do n't know if this violates any rules , but i 've found that i
prefer this bread with raisins added .

finally , as i mentioned to those who have gotten this recipe already ,
this bread makes the best toast in the world ! ( personal opinion , of
course.. )

welsh cakes

breads , ethnic

1 lb self-raising flour
2 oz butter
4 oz sugar
4 oz sultanas and raisins
2 eggs
1/3 pint water

on sale in every welsh bakery , these are one of the great delights of
teatime . the are easy to make . the welsh use a flat iron `` planc '' ( a
griddle ) to bake the cakes , which are cooked on top heat like scotch
pancakes . a heavy frying pan will do fine if you do n't have a
griddle . makes 15-18 cakes .

rub the fat into the flour and add the fruit and sugar . mix the water
with the eggs and use to make a soft dough just a little firmer than
that for the scones . tip on to a well-floured board and roll out to a
thickness of 1/2-inch . cut out circles with a 2-1/2-inch shell-edged
cutter .

heat a planc or heavy iron frying pan - get the heat up into it
gently and thoroughly , and do not let it overheat . if the pan is not
well-seasoned or non-stick , slick it with a little butter or
vegetable oil .

bake the cakes on the pan , turning them once , until well-risen and
lightly browned . they will take about 5 minutes each side . eat hot
or cold , with or without salty butter , but always with a cup of
piping-hot tea .

james beard 's cheese bread

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 3/4 cup warm ( 100-115 deg ) water
5 to 6 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt , or to taste
1/4 cup butter , softened
1 teaspoon tabasco
1/4 cup parmesan cheese , freshly grated
3/4 cup gruyere or emmenthaler cheese , shre ; dded

dissolve the yeast with the sugar in 1/4 cup of the warm water and
allow to proof . in a large bowl , mix 5 cups of flour and the salt .
make a well in the center and add the remaining 1 1/2 cups warm
water , the butter , the tabasco , and the yeast mixture . stir with a
wooden spoon or spatula or with your floured hands until the dough is
well amalgamated . turn out on a heavily floured board ( use 1/2 cup
flour ) and knead for 10 to 12 minutes or until the dough is smooth ,
elastic , and rather satiny in texture and all the flour on the board
is absorbed ; add flour if you need it . place the dough in a buttered
or oiled bowl and turn to coat on all sides . cover with a towel and
let rise in a warm , draft-free spot until doubled in bulk , 1-1/2 to 2
hours or slightly more .
punch down the dough , turn it out on a lightly floured board , and
knead in the cheeses . when thouroughly blended , cut the dough in half
and let rest for 10 minutes , then roll out each half into a rectangle
about 11 x 6 inches and let rest for 2 or 3 minutes more . roll each
triangle up , pinching the edges as you do so , and tucking in the ends
so that the loaf measures about 4-1/2 x 7-1/2 inches . place the dough
in two well buttered tins , cover , and let rise in a warm spot until
the bread has reached the top of the tin , or slightly higher , or has
more or less doubled in size .
bake on the center of the middle rack of a preheated 375f deg oven
for approximately 30 minutes , or until the loaves sound hollow when
removed from the tins and rapped with the knuckles on both top and
bottom . bake directly on the oven rack , without the tins , for a few
minutes to firm the crust . cool the bread on racks before slicing .
variations :
* instead of the butter , use 1/3 cup peanut oil or olive oil . also
use oil on the baking tins .
* use fresh parmesan orromano only - a little over a cup - or use a
mixture of the two .
* use sharp shredded chedder instead of the gruyere cheese .
* bake as one loaf in a 10 x 4-1/2 x 3-inch pan , which will make a
thicker , more concentrated loaf and will take slightly longer to
bake . source : beard on bread by james a . beard alfred a. knopf , inc .

leaves are not available . the sinhalese term for the plant is
'karapincha ' , and if you can find them fresh , they add great depth
and flavor to a dish . they are not removed before serving , and they
are edible . there is no substitute for curry leaves .

1 pkg dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon vegetable or olive oil

mix 2 cups of the flour , the yeast and salt . add the water and oil ,
and mix thoroughly . slowly add the remaining flour until the dough
can be worked by hand . knead thoroughly . allow to rise for 30 minutes .

after the rising time , roll out the dough to fit whatever pizza pan or
baking dish you prefer . top as desired , then bake completed pizza for
12 to 14 minutes at 475 b0 f , testing for doneness after 10 minutes .

additional note : since i originally found this recipe , i 've learned
that a pizza stone is by far the best way to bake a pizza at home .
follow the directions that accompany the stone , but typically you
need to preheat both the oven and the stone ( i.e. , put the stone in
the oven in its final position while preheating the oven ) for at
least 20 minutes before placing the pizza in the oven to bake . the
crust should come out just great !

potato cakes ( bakestone recipes )

breads , vegetables , breakfast

1 lb cooked floury potatoes
1 teaspoon salt
2 oz butter , softened
4 tablespoon self-raising flour
1 butter for filling

potato cakes are eaten with bacon and sausages . it 's easier to make
them with hot , freshly cooked potatoes . if using cold potatoes , melt
the butter before adding it . choose a floury type of potato , and boil
in well-salted water . -- drain the cooked potatoes well , then return
to low heat in the same pan : put a dishcloth over the pan and allow
the potatoes to dry for 5-10 minutes . ( this is called `` drying in
their steam '' in ireland . ) they should be dry and floury at the end of
the process . sieve or rice into a mixing bowl with the salt . beat in
the butter . work in sufficient flour to make a soft dough which is
easy to handle . turn onto a floured board and roll or pat out to 3/4
inch thick . cut into rounds with a 3-inch scone cutter . place on the
hot greased bakestone and cook over a moderate heat until golden
brown underneath . turn and cook the other side . remove from the
bakestone , split , butter generously , and close again . keep warm while
cooking the next batch . serve hot . ( re `` self-raising flour '' : in
ireland and the uk , this is flour which comes with baking
powder/baking soda already included . for this recipe , about 1/4-1/2
t of baking powder mixed with a plain all-purpose flour will
substitute nicely . )

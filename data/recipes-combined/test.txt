oatmeal sandwich bread

oats make a bread which is characteristically tender , moist and just slightly sweet , the perfect foil for sandwich fillings as disparate as peanut butter and marshmallow fluff or bologna and american cheese . and cinnamon toast made with oatmeal bread — the smell of toasted oats mingling with the heady aromas of cinnamon and melting butter — is enough to get anyone 's day off to a very good start indeed .

227 g lukewarm water
74 g lukewarm milk
57 g butter
28 g brown sugar
43 g honey
99 g rolled oats
50 g rolled oats , ground ; or oat flour
2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
10 g king arthur whole grain bread improver ( optional , for best rise )
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
298 g king arthur unbleached bread flour

in a large mixing bowl , or in the bowl of an electric mixer , combine all of the ingredients , mixing to form a shaggy dough . knead the dough by hand ( 10 minutes ) or by mixer ( 5 minutes ) until it 's smooth . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl , and allow it to rest for 1 hour ; it 'll become quite puffy , though it may not double in bulk . gently deflate the dough , and transfer it to a lightly oiled work surface . shape it into an 8 '' log . place the dough in a lightly greased 8 1/2 '' x 4 1/2 '' loaf pan , cover the pan with loosely with lightly greased plastic wrap , and allow the dough to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour , until it 's crested 1 '' to 2 '' over the rim of the pan . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 350°f . bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes , until a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers 190°f . if the bread appears to be browning too quickly , tent it with aluminum foil for the final 10 minutes of baking . remove the bread from the oven , and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool . store the bread well-wrapped , at room temperature , for several days ; freeze for longer storage .

tips from our bakers

if you prefer oatmeal bread sweetened the traditional way , with molasses , simply substitute 3 tablespoons molasses for the brown sugar and honey . the resultant bread will be darker in color , and slightly stronger tasting.rolled oats are easily ground using a blender or food processor ; a mini-processor is the perfect tool , because of the small amount being processed . why does this loaf contain both whole and ground rolled oats ? grinding a portion of the oats allows them to disperse more fully throughout the dough , lending it their humectant properties ( in plain english , their ability to hold water , thus slowing down the bread 's staling process ) . and leaving a portion of the oats whole gives the bread texture . all in all , the marriage of oats and wheat flour is a happy one , and a boon to sandwich and toast lovers everywhere.traditionally , oatmeal bread is sweetened with molasses , which gives it a dark color and pronounced burnt-sugar flavor . we choose to lighten the effect here by using brown sugar and honey.want to make this loaf with the help of your bread machine ? place all of the ingredients into the pan of your machine , program the machine for manual or dough , and press start . about 10 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle , check the dough and adjust its consistency as necessary with additional flour or water ; the finished dough should be soft and supple . shape the loaf and bake it in your regular oven , as directed above .

buns

454 g pastry flour blend or 14 3/4 ounces king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour + 2 1/4 ounces cornstarch
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
25 g sugar
454 to 510 g heavy cream

coating

85 g butter , melted , or 2 5/8 ounces milk
227 to 283 g cinnamon-sugar plus or your own cinnamon-sugar

lightly grease a 12 '' x 9 '' paper tree pan . or grease a 9 '' x 13 '' pan , line with parchment , and grease the parchment . parchment is n't absolutely necessary , but it makes it easier to get the bubbly , sugary buns out of the pan once they 're baked . whisk together the flour , baking powder , salt , and sugar . add 2 cups of the cream all at once , then toss and stir the mixture till the dough comes together . if necessary , add additional cream to make the dough cohesive . gather the dough in your hands and knead it a few times to make sure there are no dry spots . place the cinnamon sugar in a small , shallow bowl or pan ; or in a plastic zip-top bag . break off pieces of dough about the size of a ping pong ball , or about 1 1/8 ounces . dip each piece in melted butter or milk , then roll or shake in the cinnamon-sugar to coat . place the cinnamon-coated dough balls into the pan of your choice in a single layer ; they 'll be touching one another and , in the tree pan , they 'll be quite crowded ( which is perfectly ok ) . you may bake immediately , if you like , for 45 to 50 minutes in a preheated 350°f oven . or cover the pan with plastic , and place in the freezer overnight , or for up to a week or so . if freezing longer than overnight , and using a paper tree pan , wrap the entire pan in plastic wrap , then in foil . next day , remove the pan from the freezer , and let the buns rest at room temperature while you preheat your oven to 350°f . the buns do n't need to thaw . if you 're using a paper tree pan , set it on a baking sheet lined with parchment or foil , to catch any potential drips . if you 're baking the buns immediately ( not frozen ) , bake them for 45 to 50 minutes , till the buns in the center are cooked through . you can asses this by taking a toothpick and actually digging into the center bun to take a look ; it should look totally baked , not doughy . if the buns have been frozen , bake them for 65 to 70 minutes , testing for doneness as instructed above . tent them with aluminum foil after 45 minutes of baking . remove from the oven , and serve immediately , right from the tree pan . if you 've baked in a 9 '' x 13 '' pan , turn the buns out of the pan onto a serving platter . dust with confectioners ' sugar , if desired , right before serving .

tips from our bakers

can you refrigerate these overnight , rather than freeze ? yes , but they wo n't bake up as well . refrigeration slows , but does n't stop the action of the baking powder , so it very gradually loses its punch overnight . but frozen , the baking powder holds up just fine . if you dip the dough balls in butter , the buns will be stickier and richer . a bath in milk produces a `` lighter '' bun , both in taste , and calories .


our easiest stollen

this baking powder version of a classic yeasted holiday favorite ( a.k.a . the i-don't-have-time-to-make-stollen stollen ) is quick , easy , and absolutely delicious . the recipe combines dried fruits and toasted almonds in a tender , buttery dough , with a blizzard-like coating of confectioners ' sugar . even better it makes two loaves : one to enjoy , one to wrap and give away .

dough

269 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
99 g granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt *
113 g cold butter
227 g ricotta cheese , part-skim milk type
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons buttery sweet dough flavor , optional but good
1/4 teaspoon lemon oil or 1/4 teaspoon fiori di sicilia
163 g baker 's fruit blend ; or 1/2 cup golden raisins + 1/2 cup of your favorite dried fruits , chopped to 1/2 '' pieces if necessary
35 g slivered almonds , toasted and cooled
* reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon if you use salted butter .

topping

85 g butter , melted
85 g confectioners ' sugar or non-melting white sugar

preheat your oven to 325°f . lightly grease a baking sheet , or line it with parchment . whisk together the flour , sugar , baking powder , and salt in a mixing bowl . cut the cold butter into small chunks , then blend it into the flour mixture to form uneven crumbs . in a separate bowl , mix together the cheese , egg , vanilla , and flavors . toss the fruit and almonds with the flour mixture until evenly distributed . then combine the wet and dry ingredients , mixing until most of the flour is moistened . turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface , and knead it two or three times , until it holds together . divide it in half . roll each piece of dough into an 8 '' x 7 '' oval about 1/2 '' thick . fold each piece of dough roughly in half , leaving the edge of the top half about 1/2 '' short of the edge of the bottom half . should you fold the long way , or the short way ? the long way will give you a longer , narrower stollen , with shorter slices ; folding the short way will give you a wider , fatter stollen , with longer slices . use the edge of your hand to press the dough to seal about 1 '' in back of the open edge ; this will make the traditional stollen shape . it 's also the familiar parker house roll shape , if you 've ever made them . place the shaped stollen on the prepared baking sheet . bake the stollen until they 're very lightly browned around the edges , about 40 minutes . a cake tester inserted into the center should come out clean . remove the stollen from the oven , and transfer to a rack . brush them each with 2 to 3 tablespoons melted butter . sprinkle heavily with confectioners ' or non-melting white sugar . allow the stollen to cool , then brush with butter again , and sprinkle with sugar again . wrap in plastic wrap until ready to serve . plastic-wrapped stollen will keep well for 2 weeks or so at room temperature .

tips from our bakers

unlike standard stollen , this version does n't keep for weeks on end . however , it was fresh as fresh could be a week after we made it ; and still good 2 weeks out . by the end of the third week , it was starting to get that dry , stollen-type texture you might be used to ... so we 'd say enjoying it within 2 to 2 1/2 weeks after baking would give you your optimal stollen experience . a number of readers have asked for a substitute for ricotta cheese . you wo n't get as smooth-looking a result using the following substitutions , but the stollen will still be very tasty . reduce the butter to 2 ounces ( 1/4 cup ) . work 3 ounces cream cheese and the butter into the flour as directed . mix the egg and vanilla with a generous 1/3 cup milk ( instead of with ricotta ) . proceed as directed in the recipe .

gluten-free pizza crust

crisp and chewy , this is a wonderful base for your favorite toppings . note : you must use a stand mixer or electric hand mixer to make this dough ; mixing by hand does n't do a thorough enough job .

224 g king arthur gluten-free multi-purpose flour or 6 3/4 ounces brown rice flour blend *
21 g buttermilk powder or nonfat dry milk powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 tablespoon sugar or honey ( optional )
227 g warm water
25 g olive oil ( for dough )
25 g olive oil ( for pan )
* see recipe for this blend below .

place the dry ingredients ( except the yeast and sugar or honey , if you 're using it ) into a large mixing bowl ; the bowl of your stand mixer is perfect . mix until thoroughly blended . place the sugar or honey ( if you 're using it ) , warm water , olive oil , yeast , and about 1/2 cup of the dry mixture into a small bowl . stir to combine ; a few lumps are ok. set aside for 30 minutes or so , until the mixture is bubbly and smells yeasty . add this mixture to the dry ingredients , and beat on medium-high speed for 4 minutes . the mixture will be thick and sticky ; if you 've ever applied spackling compound to a wall , that 's exactly what it 'll look and feel like . note : you must use a stand mixer or electric hand mixer to make this dough ; mixing by hand does n't do a thorough enough job . cover the bowl , and let the dough rest for 30 minutes or so . preheat the oven to 425°f . drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil onto the center of a baking sheet or 12 '' round pizza pan . scrape the dough from the bowl onto the puddle of oil . using your wet fingers , start at the center of the dough and work outwards , pressing it into a 12 '' to 14 '' circle . let the dough rest , uncovered , for 15 minutes . bake the crust for 8 to 10 minutes , just until it 's set ; the surface will look opaque , rather than shiny . remove from the oven and top with whatever you like . return to the oven to finish baking , about 10 to 15 minutes depending on the toppings you 've chosen . remove from the oven , and serve warm . yield : one 12 '' to 14 '' pizza . * make your own blend many of our gluten-free recipes use our king arthur gluten-free multi-purpose flour , which includes ingredients that reduce the grittiness sometimes found in gluten-free baked goods . our flour also increases the shelf life of your treats , keeping them fresh longer . the following make-at-home blend , featuring stabilized brown rice flour , works pretty well when substituted ; and it tastes better than a blend using regular brown rice flour . whisk together 6 cups ( 28 1/2 ounces ) king arthur stabilized brown rice flour ; 2 cups ( 10 3/4 ounces ) potato starch ; and 1 cup ( 4 ounces ) tapioca flour or tapioca starch . store airtight at room temperature . note : you can substitute white rice flour for the brown rice flour if you like ; it 'll make your baked goods grittier ( unless you manage to find a finely ground version ) .

tips from our bakers

thin-crust is the way to go with this recipe . since the dough is so soft , it tends to spread and become thinner as it bakes , even if it starts out thicker.to bake your pizza on a pizza or baking stone : place the stone on the center rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°f . drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil onto the center of a half-sheet piece of parchment paper ( about 12 '' x 16 '' ) . scrape the dough from the bowl onto the oil and paper . using wet fingers , press the dough into a 12 '' circle , starting at the center and working out . let the dough rest , uncovered , for 15 minutes . place the crust ( with parchment ) onto the stone , and bake it for 8 to 10 minutes , just until set . remove it from the oven and add toppings . return it to the oven for another 10 to 15 minutes , until the toppings are cooked to the desired doneness .

pain au levain

though it begins with sourdough starter , this lovely bread 's rich flavor is only mildly tangy . with its wonderfully open crumb , it 's great alongside soup , stew , or pasta ; and also makes a delicious sandwich . bonus : this loaf uses no commercially produced yeast , for those of you who enjoy baking with starter alone .

levain

149 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
74 g room-temperature ( 70°f ) water
28 g ripe ( fed ) sourdough starter

dough

631 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
50 g king arthur organic pumpernickel flour or rye flour
482 g water , 75°f to 80°f
1 tablespoon salt

to make the levain : knead together the levain ingredients to make a smooth , stiff dough . place the levain in a lightly oiled bowl , cover it , and allow it to ferment overnight at room temperature ( 65°f to 75°f ) . it should take the levain about 12 hours to mature . the mature levain will have doubled in size and be domed on top , or just beginning to sink in the middle . to make the dough : tear the levain into small pieces and add it to the dough water . add the remaining ingredients and mix until there are no remaining dry pockets of flour . if mixing by hand , use a dough scraper to blend the dough and break down the levain . in a stand mixer , mix the dough on the lowest speed for 2 minutes using the hook attachment . cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes . knead the dough by hand for 3 minutes , or in a stand mixer for 1 1/2 minutes on speed 2 . the dough will be quite sticky . allow the dough to rise for 60 minutes in an oiled and covered bowl . give the dough a fold and return it to the bowl to rise for another 60 minutes . gently deflate the dough and divide it in half . pre-shape it into two rounds . place the rounds seam side up on a floured surface , covered well . let the rounds relax for 20 minutes . shape the loaves into either a bâtard ( football ) shape or a round ( depending on how you plan to bake it ) . cover the loaves with greased plastic wrap and allow them to rise on lightly greased parchment for approximately 2 hours . loaves can also rise in an oiled dutch oven or cloche ; or seam side up in a well-floured brotform , or a bowl lined with a very well-floured cloth . alternatively , refrigerate the loaves after shaping for up to 16 hours before baking . preheat the oven to 450°f . if you ’ re planning to bake on a stone with steam , preheat the stone and a cast iron frying pan on the shelf below the stone for 60 minutes . score the loaves with one long angled cut down the center of the loaf , and spray or brush them with water . when baking on a stone , slide the parchment and loaf onto the hot stone . pour 1 1/2 cups boiling water into the cast iron frying pan . be sure to wear good oven mitts to prevent a steam burn . if baking in a dutch oven or cloche , remove the lid after 20 minutes and allow the loaf to finish baking in a dry oven . bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes . the loaves should be a rich brown , firm on the sides , and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom . their internal temperature should be 195°f . remove the loaves from the oven , and cool them on a rack . store at room temperature , lightly wrapped , for a day or so ; freeze for longer storage .

tips from our bakers

check out this helpful video : dividing dough and shaping loaves ; and this blog post : preparing shaped loaves for refrigeration .
if you need to bake one loaf at a time , this dough can handle a staggered bake and shouldn ’ t rise too much , even at room temperature .
9 ” parchment rounds are a great way to help protect your loaves from sticking to your dutch oven or cloche . be sure to oil the sides of the pot as well . when baking in a dutch oven or cloche you can either bake the loaf in the pot in a preheated oven or start baking in a cold oven . remove the lid after 20 minutes when baking in a preheated oven , and 30 minutes when starting in a cold oven . overall baking time will be a bit longer with the cold start ( more like 50 to 60 minutes ) .


six-grain baguettes

170 g lukewarm water
57 g orange juice
1 tablespoon maple syrup
64 g six-grain blend
113 g king arthur white whole wheat flour

parker house rolls

these feather-light , buttery rolls were a 19th-century staple of the parker house , a famous boston hotel — the same hotel that in 1855 created the first boston cream pie , serving both rolls and pie to the likes of oliver wendell holmes , henry wadsworth longfellow , and ralph waldo emerson . so what makes a parker house roll special ? butter . a buttery fold during the shaping process ( and butter brushed on after they 're baked ) give them over-the-top flavor . an egg , milk , and a fair amount of butter in the dough give them fine and tender texture . all in all , this boston-based roll is a bread-basket classic . one more note : the `` original '' parker house roll recipe calls for the dough to be cut in circles , dipped in butter , and folded over . however , having tried this rather messy process in the past , and ending up with rolls that popped open in the oven , rather than hold their shape ( and their buttery pocket ) , we opted for a slightly different method . the result ? softly rounded rectangular rolls , looking very much like the rolls served these days at the omni parker house hotel — still a boston landmark after all these years .

in a large mixing bowl , or in the bowl of an electric mixer , combine all of the ingredients ( except the 3 tablespoons melted butter at the end ) , mixing to form a shaggy dough . note : to speed the rising process , whisk together the milk and egg , and heat gently just enough to remove the refrigerator chill ; then add to the remaining ingredients . knead the dough , by hand ( 10 minutes ) or by machine ( 7 to 8 minutes ) until it 's smooth . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or 8-cup measure ( so you can track its rising progress ) . allow it to rise for 90 minutes ; it 'll become quite puffy , though it probably wo n't double in bulk . note that the dough takes quite awhile to get going ; after 1 hour , it may seem like it 's barely expanded at all . but during the last half hour , it rises more quickly . transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface . divide it in half . working with one half at a time , roll or pat the dough into an 8 '' x 12 '' rectangle . brush the dough all over with a light coating of the melted butter . you 'll have butter left over ; you 'll need it for the other half of the dough , as well as for brushing on top of the baked rolls . cut the dough in half lengthwise , to make two 4 '' x 12 '' rectangles . working with one rectangle at a time , fold it lengthwise to about 1/2 '' of the other edge , so the bottom edge sticks out about 1/2 '' beyond the top edge . you 'll now have a rectangle that 's about 2 1/4 '' x 12 '' . repeat with the other piece of dough . cut each of the rectangles crosswise into four 3 '' pieces , making a total of 8 rolls , each about 2 1/4 '' x 3 '' . place the rolls , smooth side up , in a lightly greased 9 '' x 13 '' pan . repeat with the remaining piece of dough , making 16 rolls in all . you 'll arrange 4 rows of 4 in the pan , with the longer side of the rolls going down the longer side of the pan . gently flatten the rolls to pretty much cover the bottom of the pan . cover the pan , and let the rolls rise for about 45 minutes to 1 hour , until they 're puffy but definitely not doubled . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 350°f . bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes , until they 're golden brown and feel set . remove them from the oven , and brush with the remaining melted butter . pull them apart to serve . yield : 16 rolls .

tips from our bakers

due to the natural tendency of yeast dough to both stretch and shrink as you work with it , do n't stress when you do n't end up with rolls that are all the same size . just arrange them however they best fit to cover most of the bottom of the pan — a shorter one next to a longer one , etc . by the time they 've risen , baked , and been slathered with butter , no one will care about perfection , size-wise . and anyway , as ralph waldo emerson said : `` a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds . ''


cheese pennies

the following recipe is for one of our favorite '50s snacks : cheese pennies , crispy concoction of cheese and butter held together with a bit of flour and baked into golden brown `` pennies . '' these are good served with drinks — non-alcoholic , or otherwise .

227 g grated sharp cheddar cheese
113 g unsalted butter
177 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper ( optional )
paprika ( optional )

in a medium-sized mixing bowl , combine all of the ingredients except the paprika to make a cohesive dough , sprinkling in a tablespoon or so of water if the dough does n't seem to want to come together . as soon as the dough starts to come together , turn off the mixer and gather it into a rough ball . transfer it to a lightly floured work surface , and roll it into a 16 '' log about 1 1/2 '' in diameter . wrap the log in waxed paper or plastic wrap , and chill it in the freezer for 30 minutes . using a serrated knife , slice the log crosswise into 1/8 '' rounds . place them on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet , leaving only about 1/2 '' between them ; they wo n't spread much as they bake . sprinkle them with a bit of paprika , if desired . bake the cheese pennies in a preheated 400°f oven for 11 to 13 minutes , or until they 're just beginning to brown . remove them from the oven , and allow them to cool on the pan for several minutes before transferring them to racks to cool completely . store , well-wrapped , for up a week .

tips from our bakers

these can be made with other cheeses besides cheddar . try crumbled blue , grated parmesan , or even some pepperjack for a bit of a kick.1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper is discernible , while 1/4 teaspoon packs a moderate punch . use more if you want a truly eye-watering experience.if you want to freeze the dough for a longer amount of time , just make sure to remove it from the freezer about 30 minutes before you want to slice it .


herb-topped country bread

here 's a hearth loaf that seems to be inspired by japanese gift-wrapping techniques : papers , like those layered with maple leaves and flowers , subtly reveal rather than conceal the gift they enclose . with this loaf , a thin , almost translucent , gift-wrap of dough just reveals the herbs below the surface .

sponge

170 g cool water
120 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
28 g pumpernickel flour
1/8 teaspoon instant yeast

dough

227 g warm water ( 95 to 110°f )
1 teaspoon instant yeast
482 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
25 g olive oil
1 3/4 teaspoons salt

topping

1/2 cup fresh , whole herbs ( basil , parsley , rosemary , or a mixture of herbs of your choice )
2 teaspoons coarse salt or flavored salt

to make the sponge : in a small bowl , mix together the sponge ingredients . cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it at cool room temperature for at least 4 hours , and up to about 18 hours ( longer than that , you 'll need to refrigerate it ) . as you can see , it 's often convenient to make this sponge the night before baking . combine the sponge and all of the dough ingredients — by hand , mixer , or bread machine — kneading to form a smooth and elastic dough . ( if kneading by hand , reserve 1/2 cup of flour from the dough for use while kneading . ) transfer the dough to a large , lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket , cover the bowl or bucket , and allow the dough to rise for 1 to 2 hours , or until it 's doubled in size . once the dough has risen , transfer it to a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface , and divide it into two pieces ( about 15 ounces each ) . remove a golf ball-sized nub of dough from each piece . ( each of these little dough balls will weigh about 2 1/2 ounces , 71g . ) shape the two larger pieces of dough into round loaves , place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet , cover them , and set them aside to rise while you make your `` wrapping paper . '' ( if you have a baking stone , shape the loaves and set them on a piece of parchment paper ; this will make it easy to slide them into the oven and onto the stone , paper and all . ) very lightly grease or flour your work surface . roll out each small piece of dough as thinly as you can into a circle that will cover the loaves . this may take a bit of stretching , alternating with resting , to get the dough to relax enough to be rolled to a thickness of about 1/16 '' . spritz or brush water over the top of each loaf . place herbs ( whole basil leaves , sprigs of parsley or rosemary , etc . ) all over the surface . remember that the loaf will expand in the oven , so crowd on quite a few leaves ! spritz with water again . place one of the thin sheets of dough over a loaf , and gently smooth it down with your hands . tuck and stretch the edges of the `` wrap '' under the loaf to seal your `` package . '' if any large air bubbles appear , use a pin to pop the bubble , then press to smooth and seal the dough with your finger . spritz the loaf very lightly with water , and sprinkle it with about 1 teaspoon of coarse or flavored salt , as well as a few more herbs . prepare the second loaf using the same technique . let the loaves rise , covered , until they 've almost doubled . about a half hour before they 're fully risen , place your baking stone ( if you 're using one ) in your oven , and preheat the oven to 450°f . just before placing your loaves in the oven , spray them heavily with water until the surface of the dough is wet . using a peel , slide the loaves onto the baking stone . if you 're not using a stone , place the pan in the oven on a middle rack . bake the loaves for 20 to 25 minutes , until they 're golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a loaf registers 190°f . remove the loaves from the oven , and cool them on a wire rack . for extra-crisp loaves , turn the oven off , crack the door open about 1 inch , and allow the loaves to cool in the turned-off oven . store , wrapped , for 3 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to a month .

english muffin toasting bread

this yeasty , coarse-textured bread makes the best toast ever , a perfect partner to fresh summer jam or preserves . a purely mix-it-slap-in-the-pan-bake-and-eat-it loaf , it 's earned a place of honor in our king arthur test kitchen hall of fame .

361 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
14 g sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon instant yeast
227 g milk
57 g water
25 g vegetable oil or olive oil
cornmeal , to sprinkle in pan

whisk together the flour , sugar , salt , baking soda , and instant yeast in a large mixing bowl , or the bowl of a stand mixer . combine the milk , water , and oil in a separate , microwave-safe bowl , and heat to between 120°f and 130°f . be sure to stir the liquid well before measuring its temperature ; you want an accurate reading . if you do n't have a thermometer , the liquid will feel quite hot ( hotter than lukewarm ) , but not so hot that it would be uncomfortable as bath water . pour the hot liquid over the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl . using an electric beater , or stand mixer with beater attachment , beat at high speed for 1 minute ; the dough will be smooth and very soft . if you do n't have an electric mixer , beat by hand for 2 to 3 minutes , or until the dough is smooth and starting to become elastic . lightly grease an 8 1/2 '' x 4 1/2 '' loaf pan , and sprinkle the bottom and sides with cornmeal . scoop the soft dough into the pan , leveling it in the pan as much as possible . cover the pan , and let the dough rise till it 's just barely crowned over the rim of the pan . when you look at the rim of the pan from eye level , you should see the dough , but it should n't be more than , say , 1/4 '' over the rim . this will take about 45 minutes to 1 hour , if you heated the liquid to the correct temperature and your kitchen is n't very cold . while the dough is rising , preheat the oven to 400°f . remove the cover , and bake the bread for 22 to 27 minutes , till it 's golden brown and its interior temperature is 190°f . remove the bread from the oven , and after 5 minutes turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool . let the bread cool completely before slicing .




swedish holiday saffron buns

these bright-gold buns celebrate sweden 's christmastime feast of st. lucia on december 13 . they 're easy to make , fun to shape , and make a pretty statement in your holiday dinner breadbasket . or serve them for breakfast , with butter or devon cream .

buns

57 g hot water
1/4 teaspoon crushed saffron threads
113 g milk
50 g sugar
43 g butter
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk ( reserve the white for the topping )
1 tablespoon instant yeast
361 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour

topping

1 egg white ( reserved from above ) , whisked with 14 g water
57 g pearl sugar or sparkling white sugar , optional
golden raisins , optional

combine the hot water and saffron , and let sit for 10 minutes to soften the saffron . mix and knead together — by hand , mixer , or bread machine — the saffron water , milk , sugar , butter , salt , egg , egg yolk , yeast , and flour to make a soft , elastic dough . set the dough aside to rise until puffy ( but not necessarily doubled in bulk ) , about 60 to 90 minutes . at this point , you can place the covered bowl in the refrigerator , and chill the dough overnight . it 'll continue to rise in the fridge , but much more slowly . gently deflate the dough , and divide it into 12 pieces . gently shape and roll each piece between your hands to form short logs , about 4 '' long . let them rest , covered , for 15 minutes . lightly grease a baking sheet , or line it with parchment . roll each log into a 15 '' rope ; they 'll fight back and shrink to about 12 '' ; that 's ok . shape each into an s , with the ends tucked in nicely . or shape into a figure-8 by making a loop , pinching and rolling the ends together , and making an 8 . lay the buns on the prepared pan . cover with lightly greased plastic wrap or the cover of your choice , and let rise for about 1 hour , or until they 're puffy ; dough that 's been refrigerated will probably need to rise for about 90 minutes . towards the end of the rising time , preheat your oven to 350°f . brush the buns with the beaten egg white . sprinkle them with pearl or coarse sugar , if desired . we like bright-white pearl sugar , as it contrasts so nicely with the buns ' golden color . bake the buns for 20 minutes , or until they 're set and light golden brown . remove them from the oven , and tuck a couple of golden raisins into the center of the 8 's , or the end loops of the s 's , if desired . serve warm or at room temperature ; a dab of butter or devon cream is always nice . store , well-wrapped , for 2 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to a month .




irish soda bread

the `` real '' irish soda bread consists simply of irish wholemeal flour ( equivalent to a coarse grind of our american whole wheat flour ) , baking soda , salt and buttermilk . at the other end of the spectrum is americanized irish soda bread , a white , sweet , cake-like confection filled with raisins or currants and caraway seeds . the version we print here is much closer to traditional irish bread than to its american cousin ; but the addition of some bread flour , an egg , butter , a bit of sugar , and some currants serve to lighten and tenderize this loaf just enough to make it attractive to most of us on this side of the ocean .

283 g king arthur 100 % white whole wheat flour or 276 g king arthur irish-style wholemeal flour
149 g king arthur unbleached bread flour
35 g sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
99 g currants or raisins
57 g cold butter , cut into 8 pieces
301 g buttermilk
1 large egg
28 g melted butter , optional

preheat the oven to 400°f . lightly grease an 8 '' or 9 '' round cake pan . in a medium-sized mixing bowl , whisk together the flours , sugar , baking soda , salt , and currants or raisins . using a mixer , a pastry fork or blender , or your fingers , work in the butter until it 's evenly distributed and no large chunks remain . in a separate bowl ( or in a measuring cup ) whisk together the buttermilk and egg . pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and mix to combine . the dough will be stiff ; if it 's too crumbly to squeeze together , add another tablespoon or two of buttermilk . knead the dough a couple of times to make sure it 's holding together , then shape it into a ball . flatten the ball slightly , and place the loaf in your pan . use a sharp knife to cut a 1/2 '' -deep cross in the loaf . bake the bread for about 45 to 55 minutes , until it 's golden brown and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean . remove the bread from the oven and brush the top with melted butter , if desired . store for about 2 days , well wrapped , at room temperature ; freeze for longer storage ( up to about a month ) .

tips from our bakers

for a more authentic soda bread , use king arthur irish-style wholemeal flour rather than white whole wheat flour.the craggy crust on this hearty , dense bread makes it somewhat tough to cut in thin slices ; we suggest using a serrated knife to cut wedge-shaped pieces . a bit of butter or jam is a nice addition .

honey curry pita with curried chicken salad

sweet honey and savory curry powder blend in the pita dough to create a compelling combination of flavors , delicious with a curried chicken salad .

honey curry pita

454 g warm water
85 g to 128 g honey
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast or instant yeast
659 g to 773 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
25 g to 50 g vegetable oil , optional but will help the pitas stay fresh
2 to 3 teaspoons curry powder
14 g salt
cornmeal , for baking sheets

curried chicken salad

454 g to 567 g chicken , cut in bite-sized pieces , cooked quickly in a skillet and chilled
71 g chopped onions or 32 g scallions
71 g chopped celery
57 g chopped walnuts
170 g seedless grapes , halved ( scissors will do this quickly )
227 g mayonnaise
7 g fresh parsley , minced
1/2 to 1 teaspoon curry powder ( start with the lesser amount and add to taste )

to make the pita : pour the water into a mixing bowl . stir in the honey , yeast and about 2 cups of flour . set it aside and allow to work for about 15 minutes . when the mixture has expanded , mix in the oil , curry powder , salt and a further 3 1/2 cups of flour . stir this together as well as you can in the bowl and then turn out onto a kneading surface where you 've sprinkled the remainder of the flour . knead the dough , adding enough more flour to keep it from sticking to you or the board , until it has really come together , about 2 or 3 minutes . then give it a rest while you clean out and grease the bowl . after this little rest , the flour will have better absorbed the moisture , the developing gluten will have relaxed , the dough will feel less lumpy and more cohesive . continue kneading until it 's springy and smooth . shape the dough into a ball , place it in the greased bowl and turn it over so that the top has a thin film of grease on it . cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let the yeast go to work . while the yeast is busy , you can make fillings to go in the pitas when they 're done . after the dough has doubled in bulk ( when you can poke a finger in it and it does n't bounce back at you ) , begin preheating your oven to a hot 500°f . knock the dough down , knead out any stray bubbles and divide it into 8 ( or 4 if you 've made only half the recipe ) pieces . on a lightly floured surface , roll each out into a circle about 7 '' in diameter . place two each on a cornmeal sprinkled baking sheet , cover with a damp cloth and let rest for at least 15 minutes . after the circles have rested , place the baking sheet on the oven bottom ( if you have a baking stone , place it on that ) , close the oven door and keep it shut for 2 minutes . it 's this initial intense heat that begins to create the pocket . the outside of the dough bakes very quickly while the carbon dioxide bubbles inside expand and separate the top layer of the dough from the bottom . after the initial 2 minutes , place the baking sheet on a rack higher up in the oven and continue baking for another 5 to 6 minutes . during this part of the baking process , the pitas should blow up like balloons . when they are done , remove the sheet from the oven and slide the pitas onto a cooling rack . as the gas inside them cools , they will deflate somewhat . once they are completely cool , you can press the balance of the gas out of them so you can slide them into an airtight bag until they 're ready to be cut in half and filled . to make the chicken salad : in a mixing bowl , stir together the chicken , onion , celery , walnuts and grapes . in a smaller bowl , blend together the mayonnaise , parsley and curry powder . when you 're happy with the combination of flavors , stir gently into the chicken mixture . serve in the honey curry pita with lettuce . store chicken salad in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week .

tips from our bakers

the suggested amounts for the honey and curry powder in the pita are fairly wide since you can make these flavors subtle or strong depending on taste .

1 tablespoon instant yeast
3 large eggs + 1 large egg yolk , white reserved for topping
57 g lukewarm water
142 g butter

pastry cream filling

680 g whole milk
131 g granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
35 g cornstarch
1 tablespoon king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
4 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons vanilla extract or vanilla bean crush
57 g butter
113 g heavy cream , whipped to soft peaks

brioche topping

1 large egg white lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water
coarse white sparkling sugar or swedish pearl sugar

in a stand mixer or bread machine ( programmed for dough ) , mix together all of the dough ingredients to form a smooth , shiny dough . do n't worry ; what starts out as a sticky mess becomes beautifully satiny as it kneads . this dough takes longer than most to develop , so be prepared to let the dough knead for up to 15 to 20 minutes in a stand mixer . also , we do n't recommend trying to knead it by hand . if you 're using a bread machine , let it complete its kneading cycle , then continue as directed below . form the dough into a ball ( it 'll be very soft ) , place it in a greased bowl , cover the bowl , and it let rise for 1 hour . refrigerate the dough for several hours , or overnight . this will slow the fermentation and chill the butter , making the dough easier to shape . while the dough is chilling , prepare the pastry cream . in a medium-sized saucepan , stir together 2 1/2 cups of the milk , the sugar , and the salt . bring to a simmer over medium heat , stirring to dissolve the sugar . meanwhile , whisk the cornstarch , flour , and egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup milk . whisk about 1/3 cup of the hot milk mixture with the egg yolks . this keeps the yolks from turning to scrambled eggs when you add them to the simmering milk . pour the egg/milk mixture back into the remaining simmering milk . doing this through a strainer will help prevent lumps later . bring to a boil , stirring constantly with a whisk , until the mixture thickens . to avoid lumps , it 's important to stir this constantly , and to run a spatula along the bottom of the pan to make sure nothing 's sticking . do n't worry , the cream wo n't take long to thicken . remove the pastry cream from the heat and pour it through a sieve to remove any lumps . stir in the butter and vanilla extract . transfer the pastry cream to a storage bowl , and top with a buttered piece of parchment or plastic wrap . this will prevent a skin from forming . refrigerate the cream until you 're ready to use it . to shape and bake the brioche : remove the brioche dough from the refrigerator , and divide it into 16 pieces . shape each piece into a round ball . space the balls on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet , leaving about 2 '' between them ; they 'll expand quite a bit . cover the brioche , and let them rise for 2 1/2 to 3 hours , until they 're very puffy . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 375°f . brush each brioche with some of the egg wash , and sprinkle with coarse white sparkling sugar or swedish pearl sugar . place the pan on a lower-middle rack in the oven , and bake the brioche for 25 to 30 minutes , tenting them with aluminum foil after 15 minutes if they appear to be browning too quickly . the finished brioche will register at least 190°f on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center . remove the brioche from the oven , and cool on a rack . finish the pastry cream by whipping the 1/2 cup heavy cream to soft peaks , and folding it into the refrigerated pastry cream . slit each brioche around the circumference , making a top and bottom . spoon a heaping 1/4 cup filling onto the bottom , and lay the top over the filling . serve within an hour or so . brioche can be filled and refrigerated for several hours , covered . allow them to warm a bit before serving . yield : 16 filled brioche .

food processor french-style bread

when the weather is hot , no one wants to stay in the kitchen long . however , those of us who truly enjoy baking bread want our own creations all year long . we soon learn that we must work faster during the summer months , leaving the rest of the year for the more involved recipes with longer , slower rising times . this french-style bread is made in the food processor for speed , but can be made by hand . it 's shaped into baguettes , which bake much faster than regular loaves of bread . it 's a basic loaf which lends itself to variations . use your imagination ; if an idea sounds good , try it ! we 've listed some ideas in our `` tips '' section below .

14 g active dry yeast or instant yeast
113 g lukewarm water ( 110°f to 115°f )
1 teaspoon sugar
723 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
454 g 90°f water
1 large egg beaten with 14 g cold water , for glaze
note : make sure your food processor will accommodate the amount of flour in the recipe . if it does n't , cut the recipe in half .

combine the yeast , 1/2 cup warm water , and sugar in a measuring cup . let it sit for 5 minutes , until bubbles appear . put all of the flour and salt into the work bowl of a food processor . using the plastic ( dough ) blade , pulse four times to lighten and mix . with the machine running , add the yeast mixture , then 90°f water as fast as the flour will absorb it . stop the machine as soon as all the liquid has been added . check the dough by pulsing it 7 or 8 times . it should pull together to form a ball . watch the processor bowl where the side meets the bottom ; if there are still bits of unincorporated flour , the dough is too dry . pulse in water 1 tablespoon at a time , until the dough pulls together to form a ball . if the dough clings to the sides of the bowl , it 's too wet ; gradually add more flour while pulsing . the formation of the ball marks the beginning of the kneading process . turn the machine on and let `` knead '' for 60 seconds — do n't let it knead any longer ! if you have to use a metal blade , only `` knead '' 45 seconds and finish kneading by hand for 3 to 4 minutes . place the dough in an oiled bowl , turning to grease the top of the dough . cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until puffy , about 1 hour . divide the dough into four pieces . roll each piece into an oval about 15 '' x 8 '' . starting on the long side , roll the dough into a 15 '' cylinder . pinch the edges to the body of dough , tapering the ends evenly . place the dough seam-side down into well-greased baguette pans or onto parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheets , leaving about 4 '' between the loaves . cover the loaves with a piece of greased plastic wrap , and let rise until puffy , about 45 minutes . while the bread is rising , preheat the oven to 425°f . place a shallow metal pan on the bottom shelf of the oven . just before baking , slash the loaves diagonally with a sharp blade , about 1/4 '' deep . brush lightly with egg glaze . place the loaves into the oven , and add 1 cup of ice cubes to the pan on the bottom . close the door quickly to preserve the steam . bake the bread for 20 minutes , or until its internal temperature reaches 190°f . the loaves should be golden brown all around , smell fragrant , and feel lighter when picked up . remove the loaves from the oven , and transfer them to a rack to cool . store the bread at room temperature for 2 days in plastic ; or wrap and freeze for up to 3 months .

tips from our bakers

you might try adding 3 tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs , or chopped sun-dried tomatoes and olives ( either green or black or a combination of both for interesting color ) , or 1 cup of shredded parmesan . add any of these with the flour . you can also substitute 2 cups of another type of flour for an equal amount of the unbleached flour — whole wheat or rye are great . understand the loaves will be denser and heavier than those made with 100 % all-purpose flour.you can omit the egg wash if you 'd prefer the rustic , floury look in the photo . after the loaves are shaped , gently roll them in flour , then then let them rise and bake as directed .


no-knead amaranth honey-nut bread

sweet , nutty , and earthy in flavor , and soft and moist yet crusty in texture , this bread hits all the right buttons when it comes to a hearty loaf . the honey both sweetens and helps to develop the crust 's deep-dark brown color ; while the amaranth and nuts , along with the dough 's long , slow rise , enhance the finished loaf 's complex flavor .

397 g room-temperature water ( about 75°f )
85 g honey
50 g vegetable oil
447 g high-gluten flour or king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
103 g amaranth flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
170 g chopped walnuts

mix together the water , honey , oil , flours , salt , and yeast in a large bowl . stir , then use your hands ( or a stand mixer ) to mix and form a sticky dough . work the dough just enough to incorporate all the flour ( or mix for several minutes in a stand mixer ) , then work in the nuts . cover the bowl and let the dough rest at room temperature overnight , or for at least 8 hours ; it 'll become bubbly and rise quite a bit , so use a large bowl . next day , lightly grease a 4-quart round lidded baking crock or dutch oven . turn the dough out onto a floured work surface , and form it into a round loaf to fit your pan . place the loaf in the pan , smooth side up . cover the pan with its lid , and let the loaf rise at room temperature for about 1 hour , until the dough has become puffy and fills the pan about 3/4 full . place the pan ( with its lid ) into a cold oven , and set the oven temperature to 450°f . bake the bread for 45 to 55 minutes , then remove the lid and continue to bake for another 5 to 10 minutes , until the bread is deep brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers about 205°f . remove the bread from the oven , turn it out onto a rack , and allow it to cool before slicing .

for a denser , omega-3-packed loaf , add 1/4 cup golden flax meal and 1/4 cup chia seeds .


chocolate monkey bread

we 've never been partial to chocolate bread ; somehow , this cross between cake and white bread seems to fall short on both counts . but coat vanilla-scented white bread with a ground chocolate/sugar/cocoa combo , and you 've got another animal entirely . the bread retains its soft , faintly sweet character . and the chocolate , rather than coming across as dull or bitter as it so often does in chocolate bread , fairly sings in concert with its soft , yeasty partner .

filling

85 g semisweet chocolate , chopped , or chocolate chips
67 g sugar
21 g dutch-process cocoa
14 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour

dough

semolina black olive bread boats

these are bâtard-like ovals with somewhat pointed ends , a shallow , long container rather than one that 's round and deep . this shape is perfect for filling with salad ( rather than soup or stew ) . there 's lots of crust to soak up the salad dressing , and you get a piece of bread in just about every bite .

dough

489 g semolina flour ( see `` tips '' , below . )
397 g lukewarm water
120 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour ( see `` tips '' , below . )
25 g olive oil
2 teaspoons instant yeast
2 teaspoons salt
71 g to 85 g black kalamata olives , pitted and chopped

dressing

1 clove garlic , peeled and minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
28 g fresh lemon juice
14 g red wine vinegar
67 g olive oil

salad

454 g mixed salad greens
227 g to 284 g ripe tomatoes
85 g to 113 g cucumber , peeled and diced
71 g sweet or red onion , peeled and diced
85 g crumbled feta cheese

to make the dough manually or with a mixer : place the semolina flour ( or the first portion of all-purpose flour ) into a large bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer and stir in the warm water . let the mixture sit for 20 minutes or so . this will allow the semolina to absorb the water , and make the kneading easier . add the remaining ingredients , except the black olives . knead the mixture to form a smooth , elastic dough , adding additional water or flour as necessary . pat the kneaded dough into a rectangle , and sprinkle it with the olives . fold the dough over a few a times and knead it for a minute or two to incorporate the olives . place the dough in an oiled bowl , turn to coat , then cover the bowl and let the dough rise for 1 1/2 hours , or until it 's very puffy . to make the dough using a bread machine : place all of the dough ingredients except the olives into the pan of your bread machine , program the machine for manual or dough , and press start . check the dough about 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle , and adjust its consistency as necessary with additional flour or water . it should be smooth and elastic . add the olives when about 5 minutes remain in the final kneading cycle . allow the machine to complete its cycle . to shape the dough : turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface and fold it over a few times to release the excess gas . divide the dough into six pieces , each will be about the size of a large handball . round each piece into a ball , cover them lightly , and let them rest for a few minutes . flatten each ball into a 5 '' -circle . fold the circle as if you were folding a letter ( one side into the center , the opposite side into the center and over the first side ) . turn the dough over so the edges are underneath , and press to seal . cup your hands around each piece and roll them gently into ovals with pointed ends . flatten each one to widen the center . place the boats on a parchment-lined baking sheet , cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap or a proof cover , and let them rise until puffy . this will take 45 minutes to an hour , possibly longer , depending on the warmth of your kitchen . to bake the loaves : toward the end of the rise , preheat the oven to 400°f . spritz the risen loaves with warm water , and slash them lengthwise down the middle . bake them for 20 to 24 minutes , until they 're a light golden brown . remove the boats from the oven , and allow them to cool for an hour or longer before putting the filling inside and serving them . to assemble and serve the boats with salad : cut the tops off the boats , and hollow out the insides . ( reserve the bread for bread crumbs or bread salad . ) whisk together all of the dressing ingredients . toss the salad ingredients with the dressing and evenly distribute it among the bread boats . serve immediately . store the unfilled bread boats , well-wrapped at room temperature for up to 3 days . store the salad , covered in the fridge for up to 3 days .

tips from our bakers

if you want very crisp boats , place them into a hot ( 400°f ) oven for 10 to 12 minutes to toast before filling . let them cool a bit before serving . if you do n't have semolina flour , use 4 3/4 cups ( 20 ounces , 567g ) king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour for the total flour in the recipe .

more grated cheese to garnish the top

to make the polenta : in a medium saucepan , combine the cornmeal and cold water , stirring until the cornmeal is evenly moistened . stir in the milk and salt , and place the pan over medium-high heat . cook , stirring frequently , until the mixture thickens and bubbles . continue cooking for 5 to 7 minutes more , until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan . remove from the heat and set aside to cool to lukewarm . to make the dough : in the bowl of your mixer combine the cooled polenta , water , yeast and olive oil , stirring until the mixture is smooth . add the flour , cheese , and parsley , and mix until a soft dough forms . you can also combine the ingredients in the order listed above in the pan of your bread machine set on the dough cycle . press start and let the machine complete the cycle , checking the dough 's consistency after 2 minutes of kneading time , adding a tablespoon more flour or water if necessary to adjust it . knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes , until it 's smooth and springy . place the dough in a greased bowl , cover with greased plastic wrap , and let rise until doubled , about 45 minutes . after the dough has risen , deflate it and divide it in thirds . roll each piece to a rope about 10 inches long . braid the dough , pinching the ends together to seal them and tucking them under the loaf . place the braid in a lightly greased 9 '' x 5 '' loaf pan . cover with lightly greased plastic wrap or a large inverted bowl , and let rise until the dough is an inch above the rim of the pan ; about 30 to 45 minutes , depending on the warmth of the room . after 20 minutes of rising time , preheat the oven to 375°f . when the loaf is ready to bake , remove the covering and sprinkle the top with more grated asiago cheese . bake for 25 to 30 minutes , until the center measures 190°f when measured with an instant-read thermometer . remove the bread fro the oven and place the pan on a rack to cool for 15 minutes . after 15 minutes , turn the read out of the pan and return it to the rack to finish cooling completely before slicing .

tips from our bakers

traditionally , dry polenta is sprinkled into simmering liquid , while whisking constantly . while effective , the technique requires some dexterity to avoid making lumps . a more surefire way to make smooth polenta is to wet the cornmeal with some of the recipe 's cold liquid before proceeding .

tips from our bakers

it 's often difficult to be sure gluten-free quick breads are fully baked in the middle . a cake tester inserted into the center may come out crumb and batter free before the bread is fully baked ; thus , using an instant-read thermometer is a good idea.to make this bread using coconut flour : reduce the gluten-free flour to 1 1/2 cups ; and add 1/2 cup coconut flour along with the flax . reduce the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup ; and substitute 1 teaspoon vanilla extract for the 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon banana flavor . bake the bread for 55 to 60 minutes , until its internal temperature reaches at least 200°f .

tips from our bakers

if you do n't cut the unbaked rolls deeply enough , the shape disappears as they bake ; if you cut too deeply ( all the way through ) , the rolls will form `` petals '' as they rise and look like a daisy , not a kaiser roll.note that the simplest way to give these rolls their traditional shape is with a kaiser roll stamp . if you do n't have a stamp , check out our blog post on how to shape kaiser rolls .

flour is like a sponge ; it can absorb moisture from the atmosphere , so the amount of water you use can vary depending on climate and season . use the lesser amount of water in the summer , or under humid conditions ; the greater amount in winter , or when the climate is dry.for added whole-grain goodness , substitute king arthur white whole wheat flour for up to half of the all-purpose flour in this recipe.want to keep your bread fresher longer ? try the tangzhong technique , a japanese method for increasing the softness and shelf life of yeast bread and rolls . begin by measuring out the flour and water you ’ ll be using in the recipe , going with the greater amount of water ( 2/3 cup ) . now take 3 tablespoons of the measured flour and 1/2 cup of the measured water ; put them in a saucepan set over medium-high heat . cook the mixture , whisking constantly , until it thickens and forms a thick slurry ; this will take about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes . transfer the cooked mixture to a bowl , let it cool to lukewarm , then combine it with the remaining flour , water , and other dough ingredients . proceed with the recipe as directed . well-wrapped and stored at room temperature , your finished bread should stay soft and fresh for up to a week .

to make the dough : in a large mixing bowl , the bowl of an electric mixer , or your bread machine , combine all of the dry ingredients , then mix in the peanut butter ; the mixture will be crumbly , like pie crust dough before you add the water . in a separate bowl , beat the egg and water together , then pour it into the flour mixture . mix and knead the dough — by hand , machine , or bread machine — until it becomes shiny and elastic . put the dough into a greased bowl , turn to coat , cover the bowl , and allow to rise for about 1 to 2 hours , or until it 's not quite doubled in size . to make the filling : combine the jelly and instant clearjel , mixing until smooth . you can leave out the clearjel , but the jelly is much more likely to seep out of the rolls if you do . in a separate bowl , combine the peanut butter and honey , mixing until smooth . set both fillings aside . line two baking sheets with parchment paper . to assemble the rolls : turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface . divide the dough into 16 ping-pong ball-sized pieces , about 2 to 2 1/2 ounces each ( 54g to 68g ) , and roll them into balls . flatten each ball into a 4 '' round . drop 1 1/2 teaspoonfuls each of the peanut butter filling and jelly filling onto the center of each round . fold the edges of the rounds over the filling to create half-moon shapes , and crimp to seal . place the rolls on the baking sheets . cover them and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours , or until they 're puffy but not doubled in size . while the rolls are rising , preheat the oven to 375°f . bake the rolls for 12 to 15 minutes , until they 're golden brown . remove them from the oven , and let them cool a bit before glazing . to make the glaze : melt the butter with the honey in a small saucepan set over low heat , or in the microwave . lightly brush the glaze over the rolls while they 're still warm . caution : let the rolls cool for at least 30 minutes before serving — the peanut butter and jelly will be hot ! store , wrapped , for 2 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to 3 months .

merlin 's magic sourdough bread

this finely textured bread will stay fresh longer than most loaves you 'll make , due to both the olive oil and the sourdough starter : breads higher in acid retain moisture better than less acidic loaves .

the day before : mix together the starter , water , and yeast . add 3 cups ( 12 3/4 ounces ) of the flour . cover with a damp towel , and let this sponge sit overnight . at this point , you may let the sponge sit for as long as 24 hours ; the longer it rests , the more flavorful your bread will be . the next day : add the salt , oil , and enough of the remaining flour ( up to 10 1/2 ounces ) to make a soft dough that cleans the sides of the bowl . turn the dough out onto a lightly floured or oiled work surface , and knead it , adding more flour as necessary , until it 's smooth and springs back when you poke it . if the dough feels too stiff , add a few more teaspoons of water to soften it . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl , cover it with lightly greased plastic wrap , and let it rise for 2 hours . the dough should become puffy . again , you may let the dough rise for as long as 12 hours at this point ; to prevent the bread from over-proofing and thus losing strength to rise again in the oven , slow the fermentation by letting the dough rise in a cooler place , like your refrigerator . press the dough down and divide it into two pieces . form each piece into a round ball , and place each ball on a baking sheet that has been greased and sprinkled with cornmeal . cover the loaves with damp towels or lightly greased plastic wrap , and allow them to rise for 1 hour ( or more ) , or until they 've become puffy and a pressed finger leaves a mark . while the loaves are rising , preheat the oven to 375°f . use a sharp knife or lame to make three slashes on the top of each loaf , which helps the bread to rise evenly in the oven . bake for about 35 minutes , or until the bread is golden , sounds hollow when tapped , and the internal temperature of the loaf is 190°f to 205°f on a digital thermometer . remove the bread from the oven , and cool completely on a rack . store loosely wrapped in plastic for 3 days , or wrap tightly and freeze for up to 3 months .

dumplings

213 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
57 g ( 1/2 stick ) butter
1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs ( chives , parsley ) , or 2 tablespoons dried ( optional )
170 g buttermilk
1 large egg

pot pie filling

57 g ( 1/2 stick ) butter
57 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
680 g turkey stock , or a combination of stock and leftover gravy
1 teaspoon dry thyme
1 bay leaf
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
4 cups diced cooked turkey or chicken
340 g frozen mixed vegetables

to make the dumplings : whisk together the flour , baking soda , baking powder , and salt . cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs . stir in the herbs , if using . cover and refrigerate this mixture while you 're making the pot pie filling . to make the filling : melt the butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat . whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute . add the stock 1/2 cup at a time , whisking it into the roux to prevent lumps . when all the stock and/or gravy is added , season with the thyme , bay leaf , salt , pepper and worcestershire sauce . simmer the sauce for 15 minutes , then stir in the meat and vegetables . return the filling to a simmer , and transfer to a 4-quart baking dish with a lid . preheat the oven to 350°f . to assemble : once the hot filling is in the dish , whisk the buttermilk and egg together , and add , all at once , to the dry mixture . stir together until evenly moistened . scoop the batter on top of the simmering liquid , leaving space between the dumplings ( they 'll almost double as they cook ) . make dumplings large or small , according to your own preference ; we like to top the filling with about 8 to 10 dumplings . put the lid on top , and bake at 350°f for 25 to 30 minutes .

tips from our bakers

if you do n't have buttermilk on hand for the dumplings , you could thin 1/2 cup sour cream with 1/4 cup milk . plain yogurt would also work as a substitute.you can make the pot pie filling in advance , as well as the dumpling recipe ( stop before adding the buttermilk and egg ) . when you 're ready to cook , preheat the oven while you bring the filling to a simmer . mix the buttermilk and egg into the dumpling mix , scoop , and bake.this is a good recipe for using odds and ends of vegetables , if you have them : gather any stray mushrooms , onions , carrots and leeks you have in the refrigerator , and saute them until tender before adding them to the sauce.the steam from the sauce helps to keep the dumplings tender , so try not to peek at them while they 're cooking , at least for the first 20 minutes . your patience will be rewarded with lighter , fluffier dumplings.do n't mix the dry dumpling mix with the wet ingredients until you 're ready to put the casserole in the oven . if you let the mixture sit too long before baking it , its baking powder will lose some of its rise while waiting .

bialys

'' indeed , they 're not ; while classic nyc bialys have a mere trace of chopped onion and poppy seed at their centers , these are much more generously endowed — with onion alone , no poppy seed . heresy ? perhaps . but we think their classic flat shape and chewy texture help make up for the overabundance of fried onions — if such a thing is even possible ! read our blog about these bialys , with additional photos , at flourish .

crust

241 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
3/4 teaspoon salt
14 g olive oil

28 g milk
1 large egg
85 g to 99 g panko or other coarse bread crumbs

227 g shredded or grated mozzarella cheese , or a combination of your favorite pizza cheeses

to make the crust : combine all of the ingredients in a bowl , and mix and knead — using your hands , a mixer , or a bread machine set on the dough setting — to make a soft , smooth dough . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other rising container ( an 8-cup measure works well ) , cover it , and let it rise until it 's just about doubled in bulk , about 1 1/2 to 2 hours . while the dough is rising , prepare the eggplant . lightly grease two large baking sheets . preheat the oven to 400°f . slice eggplants about 3/8 '' thick . whisk together the egg and milk . pour the bread crumbs into a shallow dish . dip each eggplant slice into the egg/milk mixture , and let it drain . then dip both sides into the bread crumbs . lay the slices in a single layer in the prepared pans . drizzle or spray with olive oil , and season with salt . bake the eggplant for 40 minutes , or until it 's soft and the crumbs are beginning to brown . remove it from the oven , and let it cool right on the pan . gently deflate the risen dough , and turn it out onto a clean work surface . divide it in half . working with one half at a time , place the dough onto a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet . pat it into an 11 '' to 12 '' circle . brush the dough with sauce , leaving 1/2 '' clean all around the edges . use as much sauce as you like ; some prefer just a touch of the red , others like a significant amount . arrange half the eggplant , slightly overlapped , on half of the dough circle . it 'll seem like a lot of eggplant in a small amount of real estate , but do n't worry ; it 'll settle as the calzone bake . drizzle the eggplant with additional sauce , if desired . top with 1 cup of the cheese . fold the uncovered half of dough over the eggplant and cheese , pressing the edges together to seal . repeat with the remaining piece of dough and filling ingredients . cut 3 or 4 slits in the top of each calzone , to allow steam to escape . brush with olive oil . let the calzones rest , uncovered , for 15 minutes , while you preheat your oven to 450°f . bake the calzones for 18 to 22 minutes , until they 're golden brown . remove the calzones from the oven , and slice into pieces to serve . yield : two 12 '' calzones , 4 o 6 servings total .

tips from our bakers

can you make this with whole wheat flour ? try substituting 1/2 cup of whole wheat for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour , to start ; if you like the result , increase the amount of whole wheat flour next time.many folks salt and drain their sliced eggplant before cooking , claiming it removes any potential bitterness , and helps prevent sogginess . we tried both salting/draining , and skipping this step , and thought the unsalted , undrained eggplant was nicely moist , compared to the salted . however , if salting/draining is something you 've always done , there 's no harm in continuing.here 's another way to approach eggplant parmesan calzone : simply use leftover eggplant parmesan as the filling . cut an appropriately-sized slice out of your casserole pan , lay it onto the dough , and go from there .

tips from our bakers

to mix and knead the dough in a bread machine : pour the wet ingredients into the bucket of your bread machine . add the flour and salt , then program the machine for dough or manual . you can let the dough rise in the bread machine ; just remember to check on it 45 minutes into its rest period . it will likely double before the full hour 's rest.because we 're partial to a lighter-textured bread , we chose to add a second rest after we 'd shaped the loaf . joy 's original recipe , without the second rest , makes an equally tasty loaf with a bit heartier texture , as well as the added benefit of being ready to serve in a shorter amount of time . for this version , shape your bread , and put it straight into a preheated 375°f oven .

sourdough sandwich bread

when you think of sourdough bread , you probably envision a crusty , chewy , artisan-style loaf . but this bread , made with levain ( an overnight starter based on sourdough starter ) is a richly flavored , soft-textured sandwich loaf , perfect for all of your favorite sandwich fillings and for breakfast toast as well .

levain

128 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
128 g cool water ( 60° to 70°f )
44 g ripe ( fed ) sourdough starter

dough

631 g king arthur unbleached bread flour or king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour *
50 g baker 's special dry milk or nonfat dry milk
50 g sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons instant yeast
57 g unsalted butter , room temperature
340 g water ( 70° to 80°f )
298 g ripe levain
* all-purpose flour will produce a somewhat stickier dough .

to make the levain : mix all of the levain ingredients together and place in a covered container with room for the levain to grow . it will almost double in size , and will take about 12 hours to ripen ( ferment ) at room temperature ( 70°f ) . when perfectly ripened , there 'll be large bubbles ( mostly below the surface ) creating a somewhat rippled effect . it 'll appear almost fluffy . if the levain is covered with a froth of tiny bubbles , it 's a bit over-ripened ; but do n't worry , you can still use it . to make the dough : mix and then knead together all of the dough ingredients , including the levain , to make a smooth , supple , and not overly sticky dough . place the kneaded dough in a lightly greased bowl , cover the bowl , and let the dough rise for 1 to 2 hours , until doubled in size . divide the dough in half , and shape each half into 8 '' logs . place the logs in two lightly greased 8 1/2 '' x 4 1/2 '' bread pans . cover the pans with lightly greased plastic wrap ( or a couple of plastic shower caps ) , and let the loaves rise until they 've crowned about 1 '' over the rim of the pan , about 1 to 2 hours . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 375°f . bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes , until the crust is golden brown and the sides of the loaf feel firm . remove the loaves from the oven , and turn them out of the pans onto a rack to cool . let them cool completely before slicing .

tips from our bakers

does your baked yeast bread ever develop a wrinkled top surface ? here 's a tip to help prevent that . slash the top of the loaf several times before baking , much as you would a baguette . this helps release the steam that gathers under the crust , which can produce wrinkles as the baked loaf cools .


daily bread

this simple bread can be made every day . the dough can easily be turned into rolls or bread sticks , as well . you can make this bread dough in a number of different ways . the simplest is in a food processor using the plastic dough blade . you can also use a mixer or bread machine , or mix the dough by hand . however you do it , your goal is a smooth dough that 's quite soft ; please see `` tips , '' below , for guidance on how much flour to use depending on what season of the year it is .

227 g warm water
1 teaspoon active dry yeast or instant yeast
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
269 g to 326 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt

to make the dough with a food processor : pour the warm water into the processor and sprinkle the yeast and sugar on top . put the lid on the processor and pulse for a split second , just to wet the yeast . add 1 cup of the flour , process for 10 seconds , and let rest for 10 minutes . this gets the yeast going , and lets the flour start to absorb the liquid . add the salt and the remaining flour , and process ; you want a very slack dough , one that barely forms a rough ball . remove the dough from the food processor bowl , place it in a large , lightly greased bowl , and cover with lightly greased plastic wrap . set it aside for 8 to 10 hours . to make the dough using an electric mixer : combine all of the ingredients , and mix and knead to make a smooth , soft dough . place the dough in a large , lightly greased bowl , and cover with lightly greased plastic wrap . set it aside for 8 to 10 hours . to make the dough using a bread machine : put all the ingredients into the machine , program it for basic white bread , and let the machine go through its first knead ( 25 minutes or so ) . cancel the cycle , and turn off the machine . let the dough rest for 8 to 10 hours , right in the machine . to make the dough by hand : stir the ingredients together with a spoon to make a rough mass . knead the dough , right in the bowl , for 8 to 10 minutes , until it 's smooth ( though still very soft ) . a bowl scraper helps the process along . grease the bowl , cover it with lightly greased plastic wrap , and set it aside for 8 to 10 hours . once the dough has risen , take it out of the bowl and make it into whatever you want . you 'll have enough dough to make 8 rolls ; 8 chewy , substantial bread sticks ; 1 italian-style loaf or baguette ; 1 round loaf , or a 12 '' focaccia . let the dough rise again , for an hour or so , until whatever you 've shaped is good and puffy . preheat the oven to 450°f about half an hour before you want to bake the bread . bake the bread for 15 to 20 minutes . remove it from the oven when it 's golden brown , and cool it on a rack . or bring it to the table and enjoy it immediately !

tips from our bakers

because flour absorbs moisture from the air , and the air is moister in summer than winter , the amount of flour you 'll need in your bread recipes will be less in winter , more in summer . in this recipe , you 'll need about 2 1/4 cups flour in the winter , 2 3/4 cups in the summer , and 2 1/2 cups in the spring or fall . if you want a very crisp crust , mist the inside of the oven with cold water from a clean plant mister three or four times during the first 5 to 8 minutes of baking .

cheese-and-herb stuffed focaccia

so , what is the difference between pizza and focaccia ? both are yeasted italian flatbreads , generally cooked on the floor of a stone oven , and always adorned with toppings and/or fillings ranging from the simple ( herbs , olive oil and sea salt ) to the sublime ( fresh garlic , sun-dried tomatoes , olives , provolone , etc . ) .there 's actually a main difference , and a lesser one . these flatbreads are called focaccia in the north of italy , and pizza in the south . in addition , focaccia is generally a bit thicker than pizza , usually carries its enhancements in the dough rather than atop it , and tends to be adorned more simply ( though you could n't prove it by the following recipe ) . the focaccia below is an instant sandwich — it has its fillings baked right inside .

dough

425 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt

11 g olive oil

combine all of the dough ingredients , then knead — using your hands , a mixer , a food processor or a bread machine — to form a smooth dough . place the dough in a greased bowl , cover , and allow it to rise for 1 1/2 hours , or until it 's puffy . transfer the dough to a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface , knead it gently , then divide it in half . round each half into a loose ball , and allow the balls to rest , covered , for 10 to 15 minutes . roll one ball into a 10 '' to 12 '' circle . place it on a lightly oiled baking sheet or deep-dish pizza pan ( or onto a peel dusted with semolina if you 'll be baking the focaccia on an oven stone ) . top the shaped round with the filling ingredients , spreading them evenly over the surface , and leaving about 1 '' crust bare around the edges . roll the second half of dough into an equal-sized circle , then place it atop the filling . press the edges of the dough together firmly to seal the two circles . cover the focaccia with a damp cloth , lightly greased plastic wrap or a proof cover . preheat your oven to 425°f . allow the focaccia to rise for 45 minutes , or until it 's noticeably puffy . just before placing it in the oven , dimple it ( poke gentle indentations into it ) with your fingers , brush it with 1 tablespoon olive oil , and sprinkle it with large-flake salt and rosemary . bake the focaccia for 30 to 35 minutes , until it 's golden brown . remove it from the oven , and serve it warm , or at room temperature . store , well-wrapped , for 3 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to a month .

tips from our bakers

want to increase the loaf 's tenderness , plus keep it fresh longer ? try the tangzhong technique , an asian method for increasing the softness and shelf life of yeast bread and rolls . begin by measuring out the flour and milk you ’ ll be using in the recipe , going with the greater amount of flour ( 4 1/4 cups ; 18 ounces ) . now take 3 tablespoons ( 3/4 ounce ) of the measured flour and 1/2 cup ( 4 ounces ) of the milk , and put them in a saucepan set over medium-high heat . cook the mixture , whisking constantly , until it thickens and forms a thick slurry ; this will take about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes . transfer the cooked mixture to a bowl , let it cool to lukewarm , then combine it with the remaining flour , milk , and other dough ingredients . proceed with the recipe as directed . both the dough and the shaped loaves can be slow risers , especially in the winter . let the dough rise in the bowl until it 's noticeably puffy , albeit not necessarily doubled in size . once the loaves are in the pans , let them rise until they reach about 3/4 of the way up the pan . this could take as long as 2 hours or so if your house is on the cool side.alter the filling to taste by substituting your favorite dried or fresh herbs for the chives , garlic , seeds , and herbs in the recipe . or use olive oil instead of butter in the dough , and pesto instead of butter as the filling . or mix grated cheese into the butter mixture and sprinkle more cheese on top before baking .
for a sweet version of this bread , use 1/2 cup baker 's cinnamon filling or a mixture of butter and maple sugar instead of the herb filling . drizzle the top of the baked loaf with confectioners ' sugar glaze if you like .

high-fiber cinnamon swirl bread

this soft white loaf features a lovely spiral of cinnamon-sugar inside . and , surprise : the hi-maize natural fiber gives it a healthy helping of 4g dietary fiber per slice — more than a typical slice of supermarket whole-grain bread . now that 's a tasty way to add fiber to your family 's diet !

dough

2 teaspoons instant yeast or active dry yeast
227 g lukewarm water
74 g unsalted butter , softened or melted
241 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
135 g hi-maize fiber
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
28 g baker 's special dry milk or nonfat dry milk
35 g sugar

filling

50 g granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
3 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
1 large egg beaten with 14 g water , to brush on dough

if you 're using active dry yeast , proof the yeast with a pinch of sugar in 2 tablespoons of the lukewarm water . if you 're using instant yeast , you can skip this step . combine the dissolved yeast ( or instant yeast ) with the remainder of the ingredients . mix and knead everything together — by hand , mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — until you 've made a smooth dough . * see `` tips , '' below . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl . cover the bowl , and allow the dough to rise , at room temperature , for 1 to 2 hours , or until it 's quite puffy but not doubled in bulk . while the dough is rising , make the filling by whisking together the sugar , cinnamon , and flour . gently deflate the dough , and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface . gently stretch and pat it into a 6 '' x 20 '' rectangle . brush the dough with the egg/water mixture ; you wo n't use all of it , but save what 's left . sprinkle the dough evenly with the filling , leaving one short end bare . starting with the short ( 6 '' ) end covered with filling , roll the dough into a log . pinch the ends to seal , and pinch the long seam closed . transfer the log , seam-side down , to a lightly greased 8 ½ '' x 4 ½ '' loaf pan . tent the pan loosely with lightly greased plastic wrap . allow the bread to rise until it 's crested about 1 '' over the rim of the pan , about 1 hour . while the dough is rising , preheat the oven to 350°f . brush the top of the bread very lightly with some of the reserved egg/water mixture , and sprinkle with additional cinnamon-sugar . bake the bread for about 40 minutes , tenting it lightly with aluminum foil after the first 20 minutes . the bread 's crust will be golden brown , and the interior of the finished loaf should measure 190°f on an instant-read thermometer . remove the bread from the oven , and gently loosen the edges with a heatproof spatula or table knife . turn it out of the pan onto a rack . allow the bread to cool completely before slicing . store , well-wrapped , for 5 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to 3 months .

tips from our bakers

adjust the dough 's consistency with additional flour or water as needed ; but remember , the more flour you add while you 're kneading , the heavier and drier your final loaf will be . if you 're kneading in a stand mixer , it should take about 5 minutes at second speed , and the dough should almost clean the sides of the bowl , perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom . in a bread machine ( or by hand ) , it should become soft , smooth , and elastic .

naan # 3

breads , indian

4 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 egg
1 cup milk
4 tablespoon ghee

in a deep bowl , combine the flour , sugar , baking powder , baking soda
and salt , and stir with a large spoon or fingers until well mixed .
make a shallow well in the center , drop in the eggs , and stir them
into the flour mixture . stirring constantly , pour in the milk in a
slow , thin stream and continue to stir until all the ingredients are
well combined .

gather the dough into a ball and place it on a smooth , slick surface
such as a jelly roll pan or marble slab . knead the dough for about 10
minutes , until the dough is smooth and can be gathered into a soft ,
somewhat sticky ball . sprinkle a little flour over and under it from
time to time while kneading to cut down on sticking .

moisten the hands with a teaspoon of ghee , gather the dough into a
ball , and place it in a bowl , cover with a towel , and let the dough
rest in a warm draft-free place about three hours .

slide two large ungreased baking sheets into the oven and preheat the
oven and the pans to 450 . divide the dough into six equal portions .

moistening the hands with ghi occasionally , flatten and form each
portion into a teardrop-shaped leaf , wide at the base and tapered at
the top . each leaf should be about six inches long and 3-1/2 '' across
at its widest point , and about 3/8 '' thick . arrange the bread leaves
side by side on the preheated baking sheets and bake them in the
middle of the oven for six minutes , or until they are firm to the
touch . slide the leaves under the broiler for a minute or so to brown
the tops lightly . serve hot or at room temperature .

this dish originated during the middle ages in england and spread all
over the world with many variations . traditionalists should use
bread , but stale cake is a good substitute . red wine can be used
instead of white . substitute milk for wine and you have a more
recognizable dish called , incorrectly , french toast .

bread : cut off crusts and cut into quarters . place in a deep dish .
mix eggs with wine , cinnamon , and sugar in a bowl . pour , once mixed ,
over the bread and leave to soak for 3 minutes . heat the oil [ 1/4

sourdough chocolate cake

breads , cakes , chocolate

1/2 cup sourdough starter
1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 cup sugar
3/4 cup powdered cocoa ( not instant )
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup cold coffee
1 teaspoon vanilla

few people bake cakes from scratch anymore unless they can produce
something that 's not possible with a mix . this sourdough chocolate
cake falls in that category . it 's got a fudge-like quality you ca n't
get any way except with sourdough and since it 's all mixed in one
bowl , it 's almost as easy as a boxed cake .

put the starter in a large bowl , cover loosely and allow to stand at
room temperature until active and bubbling -- at least one hour . then
add the rest of the ingredients , in the order given , beating well
after each addition . it is not necessary to sift or premix any of
the ingredients as long as you are careful to get the baking powder
and soda evenly mixed .

grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans , pour in the batter ,
which will be thin , and bake in a preheated 350. oven for about 30
minutes , or until the layers test done when poked with a toothpick .
the cake will have pulled away from the sides of the pan .

allow to cool about 10 minutes before removing from pans , then finish
cooling the layers on wire racks . do not frost until the cake is
completely cold .

a mild chocolate butter cream frosting is nice with this cake .

2 eggs , at room temperature
1/2 cup mixed candied fruit
1/3 cup chopped blanched almonds .
1/2 teaspoon anise seed
2 tablespoon melted shortening
5 uncooked eggs colored with easter e ; gg dye
1 icing :
1 cup confectioner 's sugar
1 tablespoon milk
1/8 teaspoon vanilla

colored sprinkles

in a large mixing bowl , blend the sugar , salt , and yeast well with 1
cup of the flour . in a saucepan , combine milk and butter , heating
slowly until liquid is warm and butter is melted . pour the milk into
the dry ingredients and beat 125 strokes with a wooden spoon . add
eggs and 1/2 cup flour or enough to make a thick batter . beat
vigorously for 2 minutes .

then stir in enough flour to make a ball of dough that draws away
from the sides of the bowl . turn out onto a floured board and knead
for about 10 minutes , working in additional flour to overcome
stickiness . place the dough in a greased bowl , turning to grease the
top . cover tightly with plastic wrap and put in a warm , draft-free
place until doubled in bulk about 1 hour . meanwhile , combine the
fruit , nuts , and anise seed . punch down the dough and return it to a
lightly floured board . knead in the fruit mixture , keeping the syrupy
pieces dusted with flour until they are worked into the dough .
divide the dough in half . carefully roll each piece into a 24 inch
rope - the fruit and nuts will make this slightly difficult . loosely
twist the two ropes together and form a ring on a greased baking
sheet . pinch the ends together well . brush the dough with melted
shortening . push aside the twist to make a place for each egg .

push eggs down carefully as far as possible . cover the bread with wax

here 's a bagel recipe

breads

6 cup ( to 8c ) bread ( high-gluten ) flour
4 tablespoon dry baking yeast
6 tablespoon granulated white sugar or light hon ; ey ( clover honey is good )
2 teaspoon salt
3 cup hot water
1 a bit of vegetable oil
1 gallon water
5 tablespoon malt syrup or sugar
1 a few handfuls of cornmeal
1 large mixing bowl
1 wire whisk
1 measuring cups and spoons
1 wooden mixing spoon
1 butter knife or baker 's dough blade
1 clean , dry surface for kneading
1 3 clean , dry kitchen towels
1 warm , but not hot , place to set dou ; gh to rise
1 large stockpot
1 slotted spoon
1 2 baking sheets

first , pour three cups of hot water into the mixing bowl . the water
should be hot , but not so hot that you ca n't bear to put your fingers
in it for several seconds at a time . add the sugar or honey and stir
it with your fingers ( a good way to make sure the water is not too
hot ) or with a wire whisk to dissolve . sprinkle the yeast over the
surface of the water , and stir to dissolve .

wait about ten minutes for the yeast to begin to revive and grow .
this is known as `` proofing '' the yeast , which simply means that you 're
checking to make sure your yeast is viable . skipping this step could
result in your trying to make bagels with dead yeast , which results
in bagels so hard and potentially dangerous that they are banned
under the terms of the geneva convention . you will know that the
yeast is okay if it begins to foam and exude a sweetish , slightly
beery smell .

at this point , add about three cups of flour as well as the 2 tsp of
salt to the water and yeast and begin mixing it in . some people
subscribe to the theory that it is easier to tell what 's going on
with the dough if you use your hands rather than a spoon to mix
things into the dough , but others prefer the less physically direct
spoon . as an advocate of the bare-knuckles school of baking , i
proffer the following advice : clip your fingernails , take off your
rings and wristwatch , and wash your hands thoroughly to the elbows ,
like a surgeon . then you may dive into the dough with impunity . i
generally use my right hand to mix , so that my left is free to add
flour and other ingredients and to hold the bowl steady . left-handed
people might find that the reverse works better for them . having one
hand clean and free to perform various tasks works best .

when you have incorporated the first three cups of flour , the dough
should begin to become thick-ish . add more flour , a half-cup or so at
a time , and mix each addition thoroughly before adding more flour . as
the dough gets thicker , add less and less flour at a time . soon you
will begin to knead it by hand ( if you 're using your hands to mix the
dough in the first place , this segue is hardly noticeable ) . if you
have a big enough and shallow enough bowl , use it as the kneading
bowl , otherwise use that clean , dry , flat countertop or tabletop
mentioned in the `` equipment '' list above . sprinkle your work surface
or bowl with a handful of flour , put your dough on top , and start
kneading . add bits of flour if necessary to keep the dough from
sticking ( to your hands , to the bowl or countertop , etc ... . ) . soon
you should have a nice stiff dough . it will be quite elastic , but
heavy and stiffer than a normal bread dough . do not make it too dry ,
however ... it should still give easily and stretch easily without
tearing .

place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl , and cover with one of your
clean kitchen towels , dampened somewhat by getting it wet and then
wringing it out thoroughly . if you swish the dough around in the
bowl , you can get the whole ball of dough covered with a very thin
fil of oil , which will keep it from drying out .

place the bowl with the dough in it in a dry , warm ( but not hot ) pace ,
free from drafts . allow it to rise until doubled in volume . some
people try to accelerate rising by putting the dough in the oven ,
where the pilot lights keep the temperature slightly elevated . if
it 's cold in your kitchen , you can try this , but remember to leave
the oven door open or it may become too hot and begin to kill the
yeast and cook the dough . an ambient temperature of about 80 degrees
farenheit ( 25 centigrades ) is ideal for rising dough .

while the dough is rising , fill your stockpot with about a gallon of
water and set it on the fire to boil . when it reaches a boil , add the
malt syrup or sugar and reduce the heat so that the water just barely
simmers ; the surface of the water should hardly move . submitted by

towel or plastic wrap , and put in a moderately warm ( 74-80 degree )
draft-free place until it is bubbly and increased in volume . ( the
poolish can be refrigerated overnight . allow to stand at room
temperature for 2 hours before proceeding . )

mix & knead the final dough ( 20 minutes ) :
: measure the ingredients and make sure all ingredients ,
including the poolish are at 74-80 degrees . transfer the poolish to
your mixing bowl . add the rye flour , caraway seeds , oil , salt , and
sugar . stir with a wooden spoon until well combined . add enough of
the unbleached flour to make a thick mass that is difficult to stir .
turn out onto a well-floured surface . knead , adding more of the
remaining flour when needed until dough is soft and smooth , 15-20
minutes . the dough is ready when a small amount pulled from the mass
springs back quickly .

ferment the dough ( 2 hours ) :
: shape the dough into a ball and let it rest on a lightly
floured surface while you lightly butter or grease a large bowl .
place the dough in the bowl and turn the dough to coat the top . take
the dough 's temperature ; the ideal is 78 degrees . cover with a clean
damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm
( 74-80 degrees ) draft-free place until doubled in volume .
: note : if the dough temperature is higher than 78 degrees , put
in a cooler than 78 degree place like the refrigerator , until the
dough cools to 78 degrees . if it is lower than 78 degrees , put it in
a warmer than 78 degree place until the dough warms up to 78 degrees .
the point is to try to keep the dough at 78 degrees during its
fermentation . if you do have to move the dough , be gentle and do n't
jostle it , or the dough may deflate .

ferment the dough a second time ( 45 minutes ) :
: deflate the dough by pulling up on the sides and pushing down
in the center . re-form into a ball , return to the ball , and cover
again with a damp towel or plastic wrap . put in a moderately warm
( 74-80 degree ) draft-free place until doubled in volume .

ferment the dough a third time ( 45 minutes ) :
: deflate again the same as before , shape into a ball , return to
bowl , and cover again . put in a moderately warm ( 74-80 degree ) place
until doubled again .

divide & shape the dough into loaves ( 10 minutes ) :
: deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling
up on the sides . transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface
and knead briefly . cut the dough into 2 equal pieces . flatten each
with the heel of your hand using firm direct strokes . shape each
piece into a tight ball for round loaves .

proof the loaves ( 1 hour ) :
: place the loaves on a lightly floured board . cover with a damp
towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm ( 74-80 degree )
place until doubled in volume .

bake the loaves ( 45 minutes ) :
: 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking , preheat the oven and
baking stone , if you have one , on the center rack of the oven to 450
degrees .
: the oven rack must be in the center of the oven . if it is in
the lower third of the oven , the bottoms of the breads may burn , and
if it is in the upper third , the top crusts may burn .
: using a very sharp , serrated knife or a single-edged razor
blade , score the loaves by making quick shallow cuts 1/4 to 1/2 inch
deep along the surface . slide the loaves one at a time onto the
baking stone , if you are using one , and quickly spray the inner walls
and floor of the oven with cold water from a spritzer bottle . if
there 's an electric light bulb in the oven , avoid spraying it
directly ... it may burst . spray for several seconds until steam has
filled the oven . quickly close the door to trap the steam and bake 3
minutes . spray again in the same way , closing the door immediately so
that steam does n't escape . bake 12 minutes . reduce heat to 400
degrees and bake until loaves are a rich caramel color and the crust
is firm , another 15-20 minutes .
: to test the loaves for doneness , remove and hold the loaves
upside down . strike the bottoms firmly with your finger . if the sound
is hollow , the breads are done . if it does n't sound hollow , bake 5
minutes longer .
: cool completely on wire racks .

1 cup oil
2 cup zucchini , grated
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup pecans , chopped

sterilize 8 ball quilted crystal ( # 14400-81400 ) jam/jelly canning
jars , lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes . remove the jars
from the water and allow them to air dry ; leave the lids and rings in
the hot water until you 're ready to use them -- the rings must be hot
when used . if you can find them , you can also use 4 ( 1-1/2 pint )
straight-sided jars . they must not have buldges in the sides of the
jars or you wo n't be able to get the cakes out without digging them
out . look for the number of the jar i 've given you -- once you see what
they look like , you 'll know what to look for . once the jars are cool
enough to handle , grease them with shortening ( do not use butter ,
margarine , pam or baker 's secret ) . fill jars 1/2 full ; place onto a
cookie sheet .

preheat oven to 325-degrees ( no higher ! )

sift together the flour , salt , baking powder baking soda , cinnamon and
cloves ; set aside .

beat eggs until foamy . add sugar , oil , zucchini and vanilla . mix
well with beater . add flour mixture to zucchini mixture . add nuts .

for the pint jars , bake for about 35 minutes , moving the jars around
in the oven so they 'll bake evenly . start checking the cakes at 25
minutes , and go from there . the bread needs to be done , but not
over-done . for the 1-1/2 pint jars , bake for about 1 hour and 15
minutes ; start checking them at 1 hour and go from there .

using heavy duty mitts ( the jars are hot ! ) , remove the jars from the
oven one-at-a-time . place a lid , then a ring on top and screw down
tightly . place jars onto your counter top to cool completely . you 'll
know when they 've sealed , you 'll hear a `` plinking '' sound . in case you
do n't hear it , double- check the jars by pushing down in the middle
of the lids once the jars have sealed -- they should n't move at all .

chive & dill batter bread

breads

1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon or packet active dry yeast
2 cup ( 1pint ) lowfat cottage cheese
1/2 cup chopped chives ( onions or scallions ; )
1 heaping tbsp dill weed , or seeds
2 eggs
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup stone ground whole wheat flour
3 cup unbleached all purpose flour

there are particular batter breads that have become very popular over
the years and this is one of them . its full of dill , chives , and
lowfat cottage cheese , and contains no other fat at all . but it 's so
moist and chewy , you 'd never think of eating it with butter .

pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve in it the
sugar and the yeast . while they dissolve , heat the cottage cheese in
a large saucepan until the chill is off . when it has warmed slightly ,
add the chives , dill , eggs , salt , baking soda , and flour . mix this
all up and add it to the yeast mixture , making sure it is all well
blended . the next part , the rising or proofing , takes time , but it 's
the yeast that doing all the work . you can determine how long it
will take by where you put the dough . if you want the yeast to work
quickly , say in 1-1/2 hours , put your bowl somewhere warm and cozy
( 75f-85f ) if you want the yeast to work slowly , say all day while
you 're at work , put the dough somewhere cool ( 55f-65f ) or in the
refrigerator . make sure your dough is covered so it does n't dry out ,
and then go away and do whatever you have to do . about an hour before
you want to serve your bread , stir it down , and pour it into two
small , lightly greased casserole dishes or 4-1/2x8-1/2 bread pans .
cover and let them rise again , this time for 3/4 to 1 hour . ( if the
dough is cold , the loaves may take a bit more time to rise . ) about 15
minutes before you bake your bread , preheat your oven to 350f . bake
the loaves for 30-35 minutes or until they are brown and crusty .

sourdough starter # 8

breads , sourdough

3 cup unbleached all-purpose
1 flour , divided
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cup hot ( 120f to 130f ) water
1 cup lukewarm ( 100f ) water
1 sourdough starter

yield : approximately 4 cups difficulty : ( one chocolate kiss , or easy )
prepartion : 10 minutes allow at least 4 days for the starter to
ferment before using . `` day 1 : 1 . in a medium bowl , stir together 2
cups of the flour and yeast . make a well in the middle of the
flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water . continue stirring
until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth . it is not
necessary to smooth out all the lumps ; they will dissolve as the
mixture start to ferment . cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
the mixture sit at room temperature . over the next 24 hours the
mixture will rise , become very bubbly and then start to recede .

`` days 2 and 3 : 2 . stir the mixture twice , once in the morning and
once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol .
towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
bubbles . by the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
liquid may form on the surface of the starter . it is simply the
alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
carbohydrates in the flour and multiply . refresh the starter by
stirring in the cup of lukewarm water ( 100f ) and the remaining cup of
flour . stir until blended , but do not worry about any small lumps .

`` day 4 : 3 . the starter is now ready to use , or it may be poured into a
sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole , or a
flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated .

1 1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup whole wheat flour , preferably coars ; ely ground
3 to 3 1/2 cups white flour , preferab ; ly unbleached
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 small onion , chopped
2 teaspoon dried mint
12 black greek olives , pitted and halv ; ed
1 corn meal

makes 1 large round loaf

make a sponge by dissolving the yeast and sugar in the warm water and
stirring in the whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of the white flour .
beat at least 50 strokes , then cover with plastic wrap and let stand
anywhere from 1 to 6 hours .

stir all but a teaspoon of the olive oil into the dough , as well as
the salt , the chopped onion , dried mint , and olives . then work in
remaining white flour until it becomes hard to stir .

turn the dough out onto a floured working surface and let rest while
you clean out the bowl . knead dough for about 8 to 10 minutes ,
adding more flour as necessary , until the dough is resilient . lightly
oil the bowl , return the dough to it , turning to coat , and cover with
plastic wrap . let rise until double in volume - about 1 1/2 hours .

turn the dough out , punch it down , and form into a large round loaf .
place on a baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal . cover loosely with
a towel and let rise again until double - about 45 minutes . ( or let
raise and bake in la cloche . )

if you have baking tiles in your oven , be sure they are good and hot
by preheating the oven to 425 f during the last 30 minutes of the
final rising . slip the loaf onto the tiles ( if you 're not using
them , simply put the baking sheet in the preheated oven ) and bake for
15 minutes , then lower the heat to 350 f and bake another 35 minutes .
brush with the remaining olive oil and let cool on rack .

damper

breads , australian

2 1/2 cup flour , self-raising
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup milk
-- -- -or -- -- -
1/2 can powdered milk
1 can water

preheat oven to 350 degrees f. mix together the dry ingredients and the
butter . add the liquid and mix well . knead for about 5 minutes ( if you
do n't know about kneading , look in a good cookery book with plenty of
pictures , it 's difficult to describe in words ) .

shape into a flattened ball and place on a greased and floured baking sheet
or in a greased and floured round cake tin ( i recommend the latter , about 7
or 8 inch diameter , as it gives a better shape ) . bake for 30 minutes . use a
dutch oven if you are cooking in an open fire , and use your experience as
to cooking time .

serve in moderately thick slices while still fairly hot . i 'm told that
golden syrup ( a treacle-like substance made as a by-product of cane sugar
refining ) is the traditional thing to spread on it , and that goes well .
jam is good , too .

notes :

* bread as made by drovers in the outback -- i do n't know how many of you
realize it , but there is a wealth of tv programmes about cooking from
around the world . we are lucky in that australia 's sbs network ( special
broadcasting service `` multi-cultural television '' ) has a regular slot for
food and wine at a convenient time on saturday evenings . over the last
couple of years we have seen series on french , indian , chinese , english ,
vegetarian , australian and sri lankan cookery , among others . if you 're
missing out , why not call your local station ?

this recipe comes from a series called `` australian tableland '' .
traditionally , damper should be cooked in the coals of a camp fire , but the
temperature in an oven is much more consistent ! this recipe has the
advantages of being simple and , with ordinary care , reliable .

: difficulty : easy .
: time : 10 minutes preparation , 30 minutes cooking .

the ginger was a bad choice .

these breads are great for making the house smell autumnal ! they
also make great christmas gifts for the neighbors .

wild yeast sourdough

breads

the chef or starter ( based by thorne on the method of lionel poilane )

1 . pour one-half cup of ( unchlorinated ) water into a bowl . work in
enough flour to make a `` moist but cohering dough . '' prac- tice will
make this stage obvious : when the soupy slurry turns to a solid ,
puttylike mass that can be massaged ( kneaded ) into a small , elastic
ball . please note that no commercial yeast has been added . this
starter will ferment , if it does ferment , be- cause of the presence ,
either in the ambient air or in the flour , of naturally occurring
yeasts and symbiotic bacteria .

2 . put the starter in a small bowl . cover with a damp dish towel
secured by a rubber band . leave on a shelf in a draft-free kitchen
for three days , re-moistening the towel as needed ( and when possible :
clearly , the atmosphere in your kitchen may dry out the towel so
rapidly that only round-the clock surveillance will really keep the
towel continually moist . eternal vigilance is impossible , but do your
best . also please note that no kitchen temperature is specified ,
since you will probably have to work with what you 've got . unheated
kitchens in severe winter weather are obviously not the ideal , but
the normal range of temperature in a modern home should work in
something like the times speci- fied here and below ) .

3 . the starter is activated when it looks and smells active .
fermentation produces a noticeable expansion in its size and a
slightly `` tangy '' odor . it can then be used or refrigerated for
several days .

the levain , or sponge : 8-ounce starter , 2 1/2 cups flour ,

put the starter in a bowl with 1 1/4 cups cold water ( cold to slow the
fermentation , on the theory that a long rising at this point improves
flavor and . be cause it relaxes the gluten , makes the job of working
in the water easier ) . work until the starter has completely
dissolved . ( thorne uses his hands : an electric hand beater is it much
more efficient . just add a little water at a time . ) stir in the flour
and the salt to make a loose mass . with floured hands move it to a
clean bowl . cover with a damp towel and a piece of plastic wrap .
secure with a rubber band and leave to ripen overnight in a cool
place ( thorne specifies 60 degrees ) .

the loaf : 1 sponge , flour , cornmeal

1 . put the sponge on a well-floured surface . begin to work in the new
flour . the idea is to knead in as much flour as the sponge will `` take ''
until it turns into silken , nonsticky dough that is a pleasure to
work . no amount of flour is specified . the limiting factor is the 1
1/4 cups of water added at the sponge stage . this kneading stage
takes 12 to 15 minutes , during which the movement activates the
elasticity of the gluten and traps air in the dough so that the yeast
can do its work .

2 . dust the dough with flour , put it in a large , lightly oiled bowl ,
cover with a damp towel and let rise to double in bulk . this is a
fairly fast rise and needs a warm environment , around 80 degrees , for
one to three hours , usually about two .

3 . flour your hands and gently rework the dough to break up air
bubbles . pinch off an egg-shaped piece of the dough and reserve as
the starter for subsequent adventures . line a colander with a
generously floured towel , and secure it around the colan- der 's
perimeter with a rubber band . set the dough on the towel and let rise
almost as far as it did on the first rise .

4 . preheat the oven to 450 degrees . heat the base of the bread cloche .

5 . when the dough is ready , sprinkle the cloche base liber- ally with
corn meal . then , grasping the towel , pick up the loaf , and roll it
gently onto the cloche base so that the round part faces up . slash
the surface in three places with a sharp knife or single edged razor
blade . place in oven , cover with cloche top , and bake for 15 minutes .

6 . reduce heat to 400 degrees and bake another 20 minutes . then
remove the cloche top to brown the crust for about 10 minutes . the
loaf is done if it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom . after it
cools , store in a closed paper bag .

yield : one crusty loaf .

kona inn banana bread

breads , fruits

1 cup butter
2 cup granulated sugar
4 eggs ; beaten
6 ripe bananas ; mashed
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup macadamia nuts chopped

in a bowl cream the sugar and the butter well until a
light lemon color . then add the squashed bananas and
the beaten eggs . stir well until all ingredients are
completely mixed . sift the flour , the salt and the
baking soda into the creamed mixture then add the
chopped nuts . again mix until blended but make sure
you do not mix the batter too much . pre heat the oven
to 350 degrees and when the oven is up to temperature
pour the batter into two prepared loaf pans and bake
for 45 minutes . before my wife died she often watched
while i was making a mess in her kitchen doing my
imitation of a bakery chef . she said that the kona inn
banana bread should be renamed garbage bread because i
never stuck to the recipe and added all sorts of thing
that i found such as any kind of chopped nuts , lemon
and orange zest , chopped apricots , chopped mango ,
coconut flakes and one time i even added some
mincemeat that was left over after baking some mince
pies . perhaps the kona inn should have taken me to
court and forced me to stop making changes to their
banana bread . perhaps my use of their name for the
resulting strange flavored versions of their banana
bread had something to do with their going out of
business some years ago .

pizza dough

breads

5 cup flour
2 pkg yeast ( dry ) , active
2 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 cup water

mix all of the dry ingredients first , then add the water . it will appear
to be too dry . do not add water . keep working the dough until it is smooth .
( this requires a little faith but it really works ) . let the dough rise once
( approx 1 hour ) . punch it down and knead again .

at this point you may choose to freeze some of the dough . if you do freeze
it , be sure to wrap it well and freeze it quickly . with either fresh or
thawed dough , let the dough rise a second time .

after it has risen , punch it down and use it for your pizza . the dough
will rise a little while you put the rest of your pizza toppings on it .
then bake as appropriate for pizza thickness and toppings .

notes :

* simple pizza dough -- i do n't remember where i learned this simple
recipe for pizza dough . it makes enough dough for two 12 x 18 pan pizzas . i
like it because it is so easy to memorize and it makes good pizzas . of
course , it is not quite as easy to memorize in its metric rendering . yield :
2 pizza crusts .

* i have tried variations like whole wheat , and just about any flour
combination that works for bread works for pizza dough .

: difficulty : easy .
: time : 20 minutes preparation , 2 hours rising .
: precision : measure the ingredients .

pizza dough~ & variations

breads , main dish , italian

-- -- standard dough -- --
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 cup warm water , 110-115 deg f
1/4 oz ( 1 envelope ) active dry
1 yeast
3 1/4 cup bread , semolina , or unbleach
1 all-purpose flour , or a
1 combination
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil , preferrably
1 extra virgin
-- -- whole wheat -- --
1 tablespoon sugar or honey
1 1/4 cup warm water as above
1 envelope yeast
1 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
2 cup whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil as above , or
1 vegetable oil
-- -- cornmeal -- --
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup warm water as above
1 envelope yeast
2 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose or
1 semolina flour
1 cup yellow cornmeal or polenta
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil or vegetable oil
-- -- new york -- --
1 cup warm water as above
1 envelope yeast
3 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

in a small bowl , dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is
110-115 deg f. ( when making the new york variation , omit the sugar and
proceed as follows ) . sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently
until it dissolves , about 1 minute . let stand in a warm spot until a
thin layer of foam covers the surface , about 5 minutes . discard
mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes .

if making whole-wheat dough , combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use
as the flour in the directions that follow .

if making the cornmeal dough , combine the flour and cornmeal in a
bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow .

to mix and knead the dough by hand : combine 3 cups of the flour with
the salt in a large mixing bowl . make a well in the center of the
flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil , if using . using a
wooden spoon , vigorously stir the flour into the well , beginning in
the center , and working toward the sides of the bowl , until the flour
is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together .

turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface . dust your hands
with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner : press
down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from
you , then partially fold it back over itself . shift it a quarter turn
and repeat the procedure . while kneading , very gradually add just
enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer
sticky or tacky . this should take about 5 minutes . as you work , use a
metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the
work surface . continue kneading until the dough is smooth , elastic ,
and springy . too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the flour
and results in a tough crust .

after mixing and kneading the dough , shape the dough into a ball and
place it in a well-oiled bowl , turning to coat completely on all
sides with oil . cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent
moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place ( 75-85 deg
f ) until doubled in bulk , about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to
1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast .

with your fist , punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in
bulk to prevent overrising . shape it into a ball , pressing out all
the air bubbles . if you are using bread flour or semolina flour , turn
the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more , cover again with
plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy , from 35 minutes to 1
hour . omit this step if using all-purpose flour .

if you can not bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising , punch the
dough down again , turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more , cover
the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate . the dough can be
punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours
before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable . let chilled
dough come to room temperature before proceeding .

yogurt pancakes

breads

5 large eggs
1 1/4 cup milk
8 oz yogurt , plain
4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup vegetable oil ( or less for dieters ; but use at least 2 t )
2 1/3 cup flour , white ( measure carefully aft ; er sifting )
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

preheat griddle and oil very very lightly . separate the eggs ; beat the
yolks in a bowl big enough to hold the whole recipe . add the yogurt and
beat again ; add the milk and oil and beat again . rinse the eggbeater .

in a separate bowl , mix all the dry ingredients ( flour , baking powder ,
sugar and salt ) . sift together . i use a flour sifter for this , but if you
insist on measuring your flour without sifting it , then you can try using a
wire whip to blend the dry ingredients . using a clean eggbeater , beat the
egg whites until they are fluffy .

dump the dry ingredient mixture into the big bowl containing the milk
mixture , stir for about 2 seconds just to get the dry ingredients under the
surface of the liquid , and then dump the beaten egg whites into the big
bowl .

now beat this mixture lightly and slowly with a fork until it is more or
less uniform . if you beat too much , or too fast , then it will get gummy .
do n't try to get rid of lumps . cook on the hot griddle .

notes :

* i use dannon and knudsen yogart , other brands might require different
amounts

* amazingly good baking-powder and yogurt pancakes -- cooks like to show
off by making fancy glamorous recipes to serve to their friends by candle
light . here is a simple ordinary recipe to serve to your family for
breakfast in the morning .

i love pancakes and i make many varieties and i am an inveterate
experimenter . this recipe is the one i have developed over the years to
replace buttermilk pancakes because i never have buttermilk on hand in the
refrigerator like my grandmother did . i made this recipe this very morning
with blueberries in it . i do have yogurt in my fridge , though , and the
yogurt can substitute for the buttermilk . yield : serves 4-6 .

* i like to put fresh blueberries in these pancakes after i pour them on
the griddle . make sure that your maple syrup is hot and that your butter is
soft . you can heat syrup in the microwave or you can heat it by sticking
the syrup jar in a pan of boiling water .

* this same recipe also makes really good waffles if you reduce the milk
to about 1 cup , but if you are going to make waffles , you should n't cut
back on the oil . if you are dieting , stick to pancakes .

: difficulty : easy to moderate .
: time : 10 minutes plus cooking time .
: precision : measure carefully .

strucle z makiem

breads , holiday , polish

1/2 oz yeast ( dry ) , active ( two standard e ; nvelopes )
1/2 cup water , warm
4 1/2 cup flour , all-purpose
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
2 egg yolks ( save whites for the fill ; ing )
1/2 cup sour cream
vanilla -- -- poppy seed filling -- -- -
2 tablespoon butter
10 oz poppy seeds , coarsely ground
2 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoon lemon juice
2 egg whites
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 can candied orange peel , chopped fine
2 tablespoon lemon peel ; grated

make the dough : soften the yeast in warm water in a bowl . mix flour with
sugar and salt . cut in the butter until mixture has a fine , even crumb .

beat eggs and extra yolks ; mix with yeast , then stir into the flour
mixture . add the sour cream and the vanilla and mix well .

knead dough on floured surface for 5 minutes . divide in half and roll
each
half into a 12 inch square . cover .

make the filling : melt butter in a large pan . add poppy seed and
stir-fry
for 3 minutes . add honey , lemon juice and raisins to poppy seeds . cover
and remove from heat . let stand for 10 minutes .

beat egg whites with sugar until stiff moist peaks form . fold in orange
and lemon peels and then gently fold in poppy seed mixture .

spread half of the filling on each dough square ( after you uncover them ) .
roll up as you would for a jelly-roll and seal the edges . place on
greased
baking sheets and cover . let rise until doubled in bulk ( approx . 1 1/2
hours ) .

preheat oven to 350 degrees f. bake about 45 minutes , then remove from
oven and cool .

make the icing : mix powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth . spread
this mixture evenly over the rolls .

notes :

* poppy seed rolls -- this recipe could be used as part of a 12-course
meal known in polish as wigilia , or on its own . wigilia is eaten after
sundown on christmas eve . yield : makes 2 rolls .

* you can grind poppy seeds in a mortar and pestle . specialty food
stores
sell grinders specifically designed for poppy seeds . some spice shops
sell
poppy seeds already ground , but like all spices they lose their freshness
much more rapidly after they are ground . this year ( 1987 ) in poland , the
people are having a very hard time finding enough poppy seeds for their
strucle z makiem because there is a government crackdown on the growing
of
all poppies in an attempt to control opium production .

1 pkg active dry yeast
2 cup warm water
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon oil

makes 8 loaves oven temperature : 260 c ( 500 f ) cooking
time : 4-5 minutes

sift flour into a large mixing bowl and warm in a low
oven .

dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup warm water , add remaining
water and stir in salt and sugar .

remove about 2 cups flour from bowl and set aside .
pour yeast liquid into centre and stir in some flour
to make a thick liquid . cover with cloth and leave in
a warm place until frothy .

stir in rest of flour , adding oil gradually , then beat
until smooth , either by hand for 10 minutes , or on
electric mixer using dough hook for 5 minutes .

sprinkle some of the reserved flour onto a board , turn
out dough and knead for 10 minutes , using more flour
as required . dough is ready when it is smooth and
satiny with a slightly wrinkled texture . shape dough
into a ball .

oil bowl , put in dough smooth side down then turn over
so that top is coated with oil . stretch plastic wrap
over bowl and leave in a warm place to rise until
almost doubled in bulk -- about 1 to 1-1/2 hours .
preheat oven .

punch down dough and turn out onto lightly floured
board . knead for a minute or so , then divide into 8
equal pieces , rolling each into a ball .

roll each piece into a 25 cm ( 10 inch ) round and place
on a lightly floured cloth . cover with another cloth
and leave for 20 minutes .

heat a large baking sheet or flat griddle on the

the section of the oven with the most heat , probably
near the top .

place a round of dough on a lightly floured baking
sheet with one flat edge or on a piece of plywood ,
spreading it evenly . shake to ensure that it will
slide off easily .

rub heated baking sheet or griddle with wad of paper
towel dipped in oil then slide dough onto it . bake in

balloon . if you would like it browned on top , turn
quickly and leave for a minute . remove bread and wrap
in a cloth to keep it warm and soft . bake remaining
loaves .

your gas oven does not heat evenly ) : preheat frypan
on highest setting with metal lid on , vent closed .
when heated , oil base quickly and slide dough onto
base . cover and cook for 3 minutes , remove lid , turn
bread over , re-cover and cook further 2 minutes .

james beard 's persimmon bread

1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground mace
2 cup to 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup butter , melted
4 large eggs , lightly beaten
2/3 cup cognac or bourbon
1 *remy martin suzy 's choice
2 cup persimmon puree ( the pulp
1 of about 4md . persimmons - not nec ; essary to peel
2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts optional
2 cup raisins -optional

source : beard on bread 1973

sift all five dry ingredients into a mixing bowl . then make a well in
the center and add the melted butter , egg , cognac , persimmon puree ,
and if you like , the nuts and raisins . mix the dough until it is
quite smooth . smooth . butter and flour four molds* , fill them about
three-fourths full , , and bake for 1 hr . at 350 f. cool the loaves in
the molds and turn out on a rack .

note : wrap in foil after cooling if you wish to keep them . they will
keep nicely from 1 to 2 weeks .

persimmons grow in many countries of the world , but often , as in
france , they are left hanging on the trees . in this country ( usa ) we
have learned to appreciate their superb deep-orange color , their
shape , and their delicate flavor , and they are becoming increasingly
popular . in earlier times they were allowed to ripen on the trees
until dead ripe before being eaten raw or used for puddings , cookies ,
and breads . nowadays they show up in our markets in a firm state and
must be left at room temperature for several days or a week to ripen
until they are almost mushy .

this old recipe , sent to me by a dear friend from the middle west ,
makes a bread that is almost cakelike in texture . spread with good
fresh butter , it is very pleasant to eat along with a cup of tea or
to use for a cream-cheese sandwich . it is unusual , rich , and
thoroughly delicious .

*traditionally this bread is baked in four 1-pound buttered and
floured coffee cans , but you can use 3- to 4-cup charlotte molds ( my
preference , ( jb ) round pyrex dishes , or round stainless steel bowls .

the american heart association cookbook .

* this is good everyday bread . be careful : it 's easy to eat too much and
get fat . you may want to have someone who has made bread before help the

1 pkg yeast , active , dry 1/4 oz
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 cup water , warm 115 f
2 tablespoon water , warm 115 f
3 cup flour , all-purpose
2 oz butter , melted ( 1/2 stick )
1 tablespoon seeds , sesame , white , or
1 onions , chopped
1 seeds , poppy

pour the yeast into a clean , small , shallow bowl . add 1 teaspoon
of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the warm water . let the mixture stand for
2 to 3 minutes , then stir to dissolve the yeast completely . place the
bowl in a warm , draft-free place for 5 to 10 minutes or until the
mixture looks foamy and has almost doubled in volume .

measure your flour into a mixing bowl , and make a well in the
center of the flour . pour the yeast mixture into this center
depression , and then add the remaining water , sugar , and melted
butter to the yeast .

mix the ingredients well with a spoon until a soft , spongy dough
is formed . cover the bowl loosely with a warm , damp cloth , and
return it to the warm , draft-free spot until the dough again doubles
in volume , about 45 minutes .

preheat your oven to 350 f .

when the dough has risen , place it on a lightly floured surface
and divide it into six equal parts . with a lightly floured rolling
pin , roll each part into a flat round about 1/4 inch thick .

place 2 or 3 rounds on each of two or three cookie sheets . rub
the surface of the rounds lightly with cool water , and sprinkle each
with 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds , or other topping . the water will
basically help the toppings to adhere to the rounds when baked .

bake the rounds in the oven on the bottom rack for about 20
minutes or until the breads are a pale golden brown . ( bake breads in
`` shifts '' if oven size does not allow entire recipe to be baked at
once . )

with a spatula , transfer the breads to a wire rack to cool .
breads will keep several days if stored in a dry , air-tight place .

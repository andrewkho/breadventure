biscuits

2 cup all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup plus 2 tbs shortening
1 cup buttermilk
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

mix the flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a medium
bowl. cut in the shortening with a pastry blender or a
fork until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.  stir the
baking soda into the buttermilk, and allow to sit for two
or three minutes.  stir the buttermilk into the flour
mixture (with a spoon, not a mixer). the dough should be
very wet.

turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface.  knead
two or three times to get the lumps out.  the dough will
be very sticky, but be very careful not to knead in too
much flour.

pat the dough out to about 1/2 inch thick.  cut with
biscuit cutter or small round cookie cutter (i use an old
8 oz tomato sauce can with both ends cut out) and arrange
on a greased cookie sheet.  bake at 450 degrees for 10 to
12 minutes, or until the biscuits are lightly browned.

serve immediately with lots of butter and molasses! from the cookie

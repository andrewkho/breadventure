Gluten-Free Fruit Focaccia
    
    Fragrant with fresh thyme, this recipe, from Aran Goyoaga, gives a sweet twist to a traditionally savory focaccia. A sprinkling of flaky salt on top enhances the flavor of the fruit. 
    
       1 tablespoon active dry or instant yeast 170 to 227g warm water 1 teaspoon sugar 429g King Arthur Gluten-Free Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons xanthan gum 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves 25g olive oil, plus more for topping 21g honey 1 large egg at room temperature, lightly beaten 142g small black grapes or blackberries flaked sea salt, for topping 
    
     Directions   Line the bottom of a 9" cake pan with parchment paper. Brush the inside edges with olive oil and set aside.   In a small bowl, whisk together the yeast, warm water, and sugar. Let the yeast activate for 10 to 15 minutes, until foamy.   Combine the flour, xanthan gum, salt, black pepper, and thyme in a bowl. Add the yeast mixture, olive oil, honey, and egg. Mix at medium speed for 1 minute. The dough should have the consistency of thick cake batter. Add a little warm water if needed.   Transfer the dough to the prepared pan. Grease your fingers and use them to spread the dough evenly. Cover the pan with plastic wrap and let the dough rise for 45 to 50 minutes, until doubled in volume. The time will vary depending on room temperature.   Preheat the oven to 400Â°F. Remove the plastic wrap from the pan, and lightly brush the top with olive oil. Gently press the grapes (or berries) into the dough. Sprinkle the top with a pinch of sea salt.    Bake the focaccia for 35 to 40 minutes, until golden brown. Remove it from the oven and cool in the pan on a rack for 20 minutes before turning it out of the pan and returning it to the rack to cool completely.   Store any leftovers at room temperature, well wrapped, for several days. Freeze for longer storage.

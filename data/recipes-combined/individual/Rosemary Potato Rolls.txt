Rosemary Potato Rolls
    
    These moist rolls are fantastic with chicken or egg salad for a quick and easy (but still elegant) summer lunch.
    
     Dough  283g water 25g olive oil 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 18g Baker's Special Dry Milk or non-fat dry milk powder 43g potato flour OR potato flakes 11g sugar 2 teaspoons fresh or dried rosemary, crushed 1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast  Topping  1 tablespoon cornmeal 1 large egg, lightly beaten 2 teaspoons kosher salt 
    
     Directions   Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.  Select the dough or manual cycle, and start the machine.  Check the dough's consistency about 7 minutes after the kneading cycle begins, adding additional water or flour to form a soft, smooth dough.  When the cycle is complete, transfer the dough to a well-floured or lightly greased work surface. This dough is quite sticky, so be prepared with extra flour.  Fold the dough over several times to expel any excess carbon dioxide, then divide it into 12 equal pieces. Let the pieces relax for 10 minutes or so, for easier shaping.   Roll each piece into a 10" rope; coil each rope (like a sleeping snake), and tuck in the end so that it pokes up through the middle.  Place the rolls about 2" apart on a baking sheet that's been lightly dusted with cornmeal.  Cover them with a proof cover or with greased plastic wrap, and let them rise for 45 minutes, or until they're puffy.  While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 375Â°F.  Brush the tops of the risen rolls with beaten egg, and sprinkle them lightly with kosher or another coarse salt.  Bake them for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool completely before serving.  Store, well-wrapped, for 3 days at room temperature, or freeze for longer storage.

Honey Whole Wheat Challah
    
    This breezy riff on traditional challah, from blogger Molly Yeh, is dusted with sprinkles or seeds, brushed with honey, and made with nutty whole wheat flour. It's great for a turkey sandwich, or on its own: hot and slathered with salted butter. 
    
     Dough  4 1/2 teaspoons active dry or instant yeast 340g warm water 50g sugar 283g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 567g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1/8 teaspoon ground cardamom 2 teaspoons kosher salt 4 large eggs 149g vegetable oil 85g honey  Topping  1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon honey sesame seeds, sprinkles, or za'atar 
    
     Directions   In a medium bowl, combine the yeast, warm water, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar and give it a little stir. Let it sit for about 5 minutes, until it becomes foamy on top.   In a large bowl, combine the remaining 1/4 cup sugar, flours, cardamom, and salt. In another bowl, beat together the eggs, oil, and honey.   Add the yeast mixture and the egg mixture to the dry ingredients and stir to combine. Cover the dough and let rest for 15 minutes.   After this rest, turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Knead by hand, adding flour to prevent sticking, for 7 to 10 minutes, until the dough becomes smooth and slightly sticky. Grease the inside of a large bowl and transfer the dough to it. Cover and let rise for 2 to 3 hours, until doubled in size.   Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment.   Divide the dough into six equal portions. Shape each portion of dough into a fat log, then form into a swirl shape. Place the six round loaves on the baking sheets and let rise for 30 more minutes.    Brush the loaves with the egg wash and top with sesame seeds, sprinkles, or za'atar. Bake for 25 minutes, until golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a rack before slicing.   Store any leftovers at room temperature, well wrapped, for several days. Freeze for longer storage.

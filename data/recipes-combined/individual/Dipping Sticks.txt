Dipping Sticks
    
    These chewy, flavorful breadsticks are perfect for dipping in an herb-scented oil.
    
     Dough  227g warm water 14g non-diastatic malt powder or 25g brown sugar 25g olive oil 1 tablespoon Pizza Dough Flavor 2 teaspoons Pizza Seasoning 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 308g Perfect Pizza Blend  Topping  1 egg white, lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon water 46g sesame seeds or artisan bread topping, optional 
    
     Directions   Knead the dough ingredients together — by hand, machine or bread machine — to form a slightly soft dough.  Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl, and set it aside to rise for 1 hour, until puffy.  Roll the dough on a lightly greased surface into a 10" x 16" rectangle.  Cut the dough into 1/2" to 3/4" wide strips. Thinner breadsticks will be crisper.  Glaze the breadsticks with the egg wash, and sprinkle with the seeds or, for a heavier coating, roll the strips in the seeds.  Place the breadsticks on greased or parchment-lined baking sheets. Let them rise for 30 minutes, covered.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake them for 28 to 35 minutes, until golden brown. For extra crisp breadsticks, turn the oven off, prop the door open slightly and let them cool in the oven for 10 to 15 minutes.   Serve the breadsticks with a flavored dipping oil (recipe in tips), with your own dip recipe, or by themselves.  Store the breadsticks, wrapped, at room temperature for up to 3 days.

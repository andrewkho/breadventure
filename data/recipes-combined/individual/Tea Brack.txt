Tea Brack
    
    Tea brack — a.k.a. Irish Freckle Bread — is a moist, close-grained, packed-with-fruit breakfast bread. The flavor of the whole wheat is discernible, yet not overpowering because it's complemented by just the right degree of sweetness.  Interestingly, the recipe uses brewed tea as its liquid. If desired, substitute 2 tablespoons Irish whiskey for an equal amount of the tea.  This recipe comes from our award-winning cookbook, The King Arthur Flour Baker's Companion.
    
       227g brewed hot tea; Irish breakfast tea is a good choice 142g raisins 71g currants 163g pitted prunes, snipped into small pieces 142g chopped dates 227g brown sugar, firmly packed 227g Irish-Style Wholemeal Flour or King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 large egg 39g sparkling white sugar 
    
     Directions   Pour the hot tea over the dried fruits in a medium-sized bowl. Set the mixture aside to cool to lukewarm, about 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly grease an 8" x 2" round cake pan. If your pan isn't at least 2" deep, use a 9" round pan.  In a medium-sized bowl, stir together the brown sugar, flour, baking powder, and salt.  Add the dried fruit, and any remaining liquid. Stir till thoroughly combined; the batter will be thick and stiff.  Add the egg, mixing till thoroughly combined.  Spread the mixture into the prepared pan. Sprinkle the top evenly with the coarse sparkling sugar.  Bake the bread for 60 to 70 minutes, till a cake tester inserted in the center comes out moist, but without clinging crumbs.  Remove it from the oven, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool.  Yield: one 8" round loaf.

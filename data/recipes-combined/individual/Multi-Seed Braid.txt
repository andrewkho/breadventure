Multi-Seed Braid
    
    Generously studded with six kinds of seeds, this healthy and crunchy bread maintains a powerful presence on the table when it's festively braided. The loaf is large, and leftovers are easily incorporated into a strata or French toast a few days later.
    
     Dough  340g boiling water 113g artisan bread topping 418g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 50g buttermilk powder 21g non-diastatic malt powder or 35g ounces brown sugar 2 teaspoons instant yeast 25g oil or 28g butter 1 1/2 teaspoons salt  Topping  1 egg white beaten with 14g water artisan bread topping, or your favorite combination of seeds 
    
     Directions   Mix together the boiling water and grain blend, and cool to lukewarm.  Combine the water and grains with all of the remaining dough ingredients and mix, then knead — by hand, mixer or bread machine, about 8 minutes — to form a smooth, soft dough, adding additional water or flour as necessary.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, until almost doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.  Prepare a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet; use parchment if you're planning to bake directly on an oven stone, as you can easily transfer the loaf, parchment and all, to the stone.  Divide the dough, and roll it into three 14" logs. Braid the logs on the prepared baking sheet.  Brush the loaf with the egg white, then sprinkle it heavily with seeds.  Allow the braid to rise, covered (a proof cover works well here) for about 45 minutes, until it's quite puffy looking.  While the braid rises, preheat your oven to 400°F.  Bake the bread in the preheated oven — directly on an oven stone, if possible — for 28 to 35 minutes, until it's golden brown and its interior temperature is 195°F or higher.  Remove the loaf from the oven, and cool it on a rack.   Store for up to 5 days at room-temperature, well-wrapped, or freeze for up to 3 months.

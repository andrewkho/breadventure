3/4 oz yeast (3 packages)
3/4 cup water, water
2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup butter, melted
1 tablespoon salt
1/4 cup honey
2 cup raisins
8  eggs
9 cup flour
      ----glaze----
2  egg yolks
5 teaspoon water

dissolve the yeast with the warm water and sugar.  add the rest of the
sugar, butter, salt, honey, raisins and eggs. add the flour, a cup at a
time, until it is hard to stir.

turn out onto a well-floured counter and knead until smooth and blistery,
adding more flour as necessary (about 10-15 minutes).  put into greased
bowl, cover, and let rise until double, about 1 hr.

punch down.  separate into 4 sections and separate each section into 3 more
sections. roll each piece out to the size of your cookie sheet. braid 3
strands together and place on cookie sheet. let rise until double (about
1    hour).

mix egg yolks and water for glaze.  spread on loaves.  bake in a preheated
oven at 350 degrees f. for 15-30 minutes until there is a golden crust.

notes:

*  jewish egg bread -- this is my family's version of challah.  it calls
for saffron, but i've never actually made it as such (hey, i'm just a poor
college student, i can't afford saffron).

: difficulty:  easy, if you know how to make bread
: time:  20 minutes preparation, several hours rising, 30 minutes cooking
: precision:  raisins are to taste.  measure the rest of the ingredients.

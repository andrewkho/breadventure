       2 large eggs 114g molasses or honey 99g vegetable oil 71g brown sugar  1 teaspoon vanilla extract 241g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour or Premium Whole Wheat Flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 340g shredded, unpeeled zucchini (about 1 small/medium zucchini) 170g chocolate chips 85g chopped walnuts, optional 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F; lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.   In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, molasses or honey, oil, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.    Add the flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon, mixing until well combined.    Stir in the zucchini, chocolate chips, and nuts.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake the bread for 55 to 60 minutes, until the loaf tests done (a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean, save for perhaps a smear of chocolate).   Remove the bread from the oven, and let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes before turning it out of the pan onto a rack.   Cool completely before slicing; store well-wrapped, at room temperature.  Yield: one 9" x 5" loaf.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Want to make this bread gluten-free? Substitute 2 cups King Arthur Gluten-Free Flour for the whole wheat flour; add an additional 1 large egg and 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum; let the batter rest for 15 to 20 minutes before pouring it into the pan; and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until it tests done with a toothpick. Also, make sure the vanilla extract you use is gluten-free.

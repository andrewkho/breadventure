Cheddar Cheese Bread
    
    A delightful hint of Cheddar cheese permeates this golden loaf. Use it as a base for a grilled sandwich, or to add a new depth to a breakfast strata.
    
       361g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 1 teaspoon instant yeast 1 teaspoon Pizza Dough Flavor, optional 14g sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 28g butter, room temperature 113g water 149g milk 128g shredded sharp Cheddar cheese 
    
     Directions   In a large bowl, mix together all the ingredients except the cheese, stirring them to form a shaggy mass.  Let the mixture sit for 15 minutes, then knead it — by hand or machine — until you've formed a smooth, elastic dough.   Knead in the cheese, place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise for 1 hour. After the hour it should be puffy, though not doubled in size.  Lightly grease or spray an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased or floured work surface, and shape it into a loaf. Place it in the pan, and let it rise for about 1 hour.  Toward the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F.   Bake the bread for 25 minutes, or until a digital thermometer inserted into the center reads 190°F.   Store the bread, well-wrapped, for up to 5 days at room temperature or in the freezer for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  If the bread appears to be browning too quickly, tent it lightly with aluminum foil after the first 15 minutes of baking.

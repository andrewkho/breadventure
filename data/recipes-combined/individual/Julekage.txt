Julekage
    
    The Scandinavian countries lay claim to julekage, a spiced and fruited Christmas cake. It's often scented with cardamom and given a decorative topping, then served with coffee for a holiday treat.
    
     Dough  1 1/2 teaspoons salt 99g sugar 3/4 to 1 teaspoon cardamom, to taste 390g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 11g baking powder 85g golden raisins or sultanas 64g diced or slivered dried apricots 99g chopped Candied Cherries 283g milk 57g butter, melted and cooled a bit 3 large eggs  Glaze  1 egg white, lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon sugar pearl sugar or coarse sugar almonds, optional 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients and the fruits.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, melted butter, and eggs.  Add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring to moisten thoroughly.  Pour the batter into the pan.  Smooth the batter in the pan, and brush it with the beaten egg white. It may seem a bit awkward brushing quick bread batter with a wash, but just use a soft pastry brush and be gentle, it'll work.  Sprinkle the bread with the sugar (and almonds, if desired).   Bake the bread for about 55 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean. It'll probably crack on the top; that's OK.   Let it cool in the pan for 15 minutes, then carefully turn it out onto a rack to cool completely before slicing. Some of the sugar and/or almonds may fall off, even with the wash. It's aggravating, but unavoidable.   Wrap the bread for storage at room temperature for up to 5 days, and up to 3 months in the freezer.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  This is the fruit mixture we like. A more traditional mixture would be candied cherries and pineapple, and mixed peel. Just use 1 1/2 cups, total, of whatever combination of dried/candied, chopped fruits strike your fancy.

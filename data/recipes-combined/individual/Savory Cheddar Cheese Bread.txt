Savory Cheddar Cheese Bread
    
    The bite of cheese in a loaf of plain white bread is always welcome. This bread is very close-grained, and is wonderful for toast or sandwiches — especially grilled cheese! The addition of a half teaspoon of tabasco sauce gives the bread just a hint of heat.      The loaf is designed to bake in a Zojirushi full-sized bread machine, though you can certainly prepare and bake the dough by hand: after its first rise, shape the dough and place it in an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" pan; let it rise, then bake it in a preheated 350°F oven for about 35 to 40 minutes.
    
       227g lukewarm milk* 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1 tablespoon sugar 113g grated extra-sharp cheddar cheese; we prefer Cabot extra-sharp  28g Vermont cheese powder** 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1/2 to 1 teaspoon tabasco sauce, optional *Add an additional tablespoon of milk during the winter, or if you live in a dry climate. **Substitute grated Parmesan cheese, if desired. 
    
     Directions   Put all of the ingredients into the bucket of your bread machine in the order designated.  Program the machine for basic bread, light crust setting. Press Start.  Check the dough after about 10 minutes of kneading; it should have formed a cohesive ball, and be slightly sticky. Adjust its consistency with additional milk or flour, if necessary.  Allow the machine to complete its cycle. Remove the bread from the machine, and cool it on a rack.  Yield: 1 loaf.

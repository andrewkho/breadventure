     Directions   Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine according to the manufacturer's directions. Program the machine for basic bread, and press Start.  Check the dough about 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, and adjust its consistency by adding a tablespoon or so of water if it seems dry and looks "gnarly." The dough should be firm, though slightly sticky.  Allow the machine to complete its cycle.  Remove the bread when it's finished baking, and transfer it from the pan to a wire rack to cool.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  You may also make this bread without the aid of a bread machine; or make the dough in a bread machine, and bake it in the oven. Simply make the dough using your usual method (by hand, electric mixer or bread machine); shape it into a log; and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan. Allow the loaf to rise, covered, until it's crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan. Bake it in a preheated 350°F oven for 35 minutes, or until its interior temperature registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven, remove it from the pan, and cool it on a wire rack.

Maple-Walnut Bread
    
    Steaming bread produces very different results than a yeast bread and is far more forgiving than a traditional oven bake. The bread never gets hotter than 212Â°F (the temperature of boiling water), and "bakes" for a much longer time than it would in the oven.Using a moist cooking method means the bread doesn't dry out and keeps well, despite using much less added fat. It serves as a lower-fat alternative to a pastry and as a filling breakfast or dinner side with baked beans.
    
       67g yellow cornmeal 113g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 50g dried buttermilk powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 16g non-diastatic malt powder 113g coarsely chopped walnuts 1/4 teaspoon maple flavor 156g maple syrup 170g water 
    
     Directions   In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together all of the dry ingredients until they're well-blended.  Stir the maple syrup into the water, and combine the wet and dry ingredients, mixing just until everything is moistened.  Butter or grease the inside of a 1-pound steamer pan.   Spoon the batter into the pan, and cover it with a piece of greased aluminum foil.   Put 2" to 3" of water in a covered saucepan taller than your steamer pan, and place the steamer in the saucepan.  Bring the water to a simmer. Cover the pan, and simmer the bread for 3 hours, replenishing with additional simmering water as needed, until the bread is done (a cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean).  Remove the pan from the saucepan, allow it to cool for 30 minutes, then turn the bread out to cool completely.  Store the bread, well-wrapped, in the fridge for up to a week or freeze it for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  For the best texture and flavor, let the bread rest overnight before serving.

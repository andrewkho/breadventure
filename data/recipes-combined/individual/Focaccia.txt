Focaccia
    
    Focaccia, a simple Italian flatbread, can be patted thin for bread with a lot of chew, or thicker for a softer bread. The drizzle of olive oil and scattering of herbs is key to the bread's delicious flavor. 
    
       1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast or instant yeast 1/2 teaspoon sugar 227g warm water 1/2 teaspoon salt 57g King Arthur Premium Whole Wheat Flour 301g (approximately) King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 25g extra-virgin olive oil, to drizzle on the focaccia after baking 
    
     Directions   Dissolve the yeast and sugar in the water. Add 1/4 cup of the all-purpose flour. Stir with a whisk and let this sit for 10 minutes to give the yeast a chance to get going.  Add the salt and the whole wheat flour. Add the rest of the all-purpose flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough is pulling away from the sides of the bowl.   Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead it, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough has formed a smooth ball. Place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn the dough to coat it with the oil.  Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Let the dough rise in a draft-free place for 1 1/2 to 2 hours.   When the dough has doubled in bulk, gently deflate it, and turn it out onto a lightly floured counter. Stretch the dough into a 14" circle and place on a greased baking sheet.  Preheat the oven to 425Â°F while the focaccia is rising. Let it rise for 30 minutes.  Dimple the focaccia with your fingers and place it in the oven. Bake for approximately 25 minutes, or until lightly browned and cooked through.  Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle with fresh or dried rosemary and/or oregano. Cut into 6 to 12 wedges. Serve as is, or with marinara sauce, if desired.   
    
     Tips from our bakers  While the 1/2 cup of whole wheat flour lends this bread a bit of compelling earthiness, substitute all-purpose flour for the whole wheat, if you like.

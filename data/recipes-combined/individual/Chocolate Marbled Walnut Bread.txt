Chocolate Marbled Walnut Bread
    
    This is a medium-sized loaf with a fine crumb and swirl of dark chocolate beautifully marbled throughout. Make sure to use a light crust setting, if possible, so the chocolate chips on the outside surface of the loaf don't burn.
    
       340g water 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 418g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 64g walnut halves 170g semisweet chocolate chips 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients except the chocolate chips and walnuts into the pan of your bread machine. Program the machine for raisin bread, if possible.  Check the dough after 10 to 15 minutes of kneading; it should have formed a smooth ball, soft but not sticky. If necessary, adjust the dough's consistency with additional water or flour.  Add the chips and nuts at the signal; or, if you have no raisin bread cycle, add them about 3 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle.  Store for up to 5 days, well-wrapped at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

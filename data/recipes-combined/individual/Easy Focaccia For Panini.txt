Easy Focaccia For Panini
    
    Somehow a panini sounds so much more sophisticated and appealing than a flat bread sandwich — and the focaccia used for the bread is really no more difficult to make than any other ordinary loaf. Make the bread, cool it, and fill it with thinner layers of meats or veggies with cheese. Grill in a panini press, or use the old grilled cheese pan, and slowly sauté the sandwich with a plate or weight on top to meld the sandwich together.
    
       340g Pastry Flour Blend (See "tips," below.) 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 25g olive oil 340g warm water 1 teaspoon baking powder 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, beat for 5 minutes with an electric mixer set at medium speed, and let rest at room temperature, covered, for 1 hour, or until it's bubbly.   Lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan.   Scoop the batter into the pan, cover the pan, and let the dough rise for 1 hour, until it looks bubbly.  Preheat the oven to 400°F.  Bake the focaccia for 25 minutes, or until it's golden brown.  Remove focaccia from the oven, remove it from the pan, and let it cool on a wire rack.  To make panini, cut focaccia into squares, slice, add fillings, and grill.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 4 days, or freeze for up to a month.

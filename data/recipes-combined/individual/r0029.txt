ingredients are moistened. spoon 1/3 of the batter into 12 greased
muffin cups. place 2 teaspoons of goat cheee in center of batter in
each cup. cover cheese with remaining batter, dividing among each of
the muffins. bake approximately 20 minutes in a preheated 350 degree
f oven, or until brown and springy in the center.

serve muffins hot or cool.  if desired, a 3/4-inch cube of cream
cheese may be substituted for goat cheese. without cheese, muffins
are still delicious!

    This tasty sandwich loaf has a beautiful golden interior, and its crust is coated with a crunchy layer of sesame seeds. It makes lovely toast and sandwiches — especially grilled cheese!
    
       383g semolina flour 67g yellow cornmeal 25g sugar 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 57g butter   198g water 1 large egg 35g sesame seeds 14g milk, for brushing crust 
    
     Directions   In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients except the sesame seeds and milk, mixing to form a shaggy dough.  Knead the dough, by hand or by machine, for 10 minutes, or until it's smooth and supple.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour; it'll become quite puffy, though it may not double in bulk. You may also use your bread machine, set on the dough cycle, to prepare the dough to this point.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and shape it into a log. Grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan, and sprinkle it heavily with sesame seeds.   Place the loaf in the pan, brush it with milk or a bit of beaten egg white, and sprinkle it with additional sesame seeds. Cover the pan with lightly greased plastic wrap, or a shower cap. Allow the loaf to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it's crowned about 1" above the rim of the bread pan.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for about 40 minutes, or until its interior registers 190°F on a digital thermometer.  Store the cooled bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.

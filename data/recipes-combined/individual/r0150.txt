basic sourdough bread**

breads

1 cup sourdough starter
2 1/2 cup flour
2 cup warm water
3 3/4 to 4-1/4 c flour
3 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
3 tablespoon vegetable oil

cold water

mix 1 st 3 ingreds. in 3 qt. glass bowl with wooden spoon until
smooth. cover; let stand in warm, draft-free place for 8 hours. add
3-3/4 c flour, sugar, salt, baking soda and oil to the mixture in
bowl. stir with wooden spoon until smooth and flour is completely
absorbed. (dough should be just firm enough to gather into a ball. if
necessary, add remaining 1/2 c flour gradually, stirring until all
flour is absorbed.) turn dough onto heavily floured surface; knead
until smooth and elastic, about 10 minutes. place in greased bowl;
turn greased side up. cover; let rise in warm place until double,
about 1-1/2 hours. (dough is ready if indentation remains when
touched.) punch dough down; divide into halves. shape each half into
a round,  slightly flat loaf. do not tear dough by pulling. place
loaves in opposite corners of greased cookie sheet. make three 1/4"
deep slashes in each loaf. let rise until double, about 45 minutes.
heat oven to 375. brush loaves with cold water. place cookie sheet in
center of oven; it should not touch the sides of the oven. bake,
brushing occasionally with water, until loaves sound hollow when
tapped, about 50 minutes. remove from cookie sheets; cool on wire
racks.

be sure to let dough rise completely both times - it might take
longer than the estimated times given.

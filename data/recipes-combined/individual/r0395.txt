put the flour and salt into a bowl.  add the water and mix to a stiff
dough; knead well until the dough feels firm and elastic. then place
in a greased plastic bag or in grease proof paper and leave in a warm
place for 30 minutes.  turn onto a floured board, shape the dough
into a long roll, and divide into 12 equal slices. roll out paper
thin. heat the heavy frying pan and when very hot, cook the chapatis
for not more than one minute on either side.  cool in a tea towel.
chapatis should always be cooked fresh for each meal.

to cook them, you can use an ungreased heavy frying pan, griddle,
bakestone or solid plate.

left-over chapatis make an attractive crispbread when dried off in a
cool oven.

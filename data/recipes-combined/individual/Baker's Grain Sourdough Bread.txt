Baker's Grain Sourdough Bread
    
    The unique flavor of our Ancient Grains Flour Blend lends a subtle nutty/earthy flavor to this bread. The flavor, and the bread's soft, moist interior and tender crumb, make it a great toasting and sandwich bread.
    
       227g sourdough starter, ripe (fed) or discard 227g lukewarm water 25g vegetable oil 43g honey 2 teaspoons salt 269g Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour 71g Ancient Grains Flour Blend 85g potato flour or instant potato flakes 74g Harvest Grains Blend 2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead all the ingredients — in a mixer bowl or the pan of a bread machine — to make a smooth dough. The dough will be a little bit sticky; but as long as it's firm enough to hold its shape, no more flour is necessary.  Cover the dough and allow it to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until noticeably puffy, though not doubled in bulk.  Lightly grease the base pan of a long covered baker.  If you don't have a covered stoneware baker, see tips, at left.    Gently deflate the risen dough, and shape it into a log. Place it in the baker, put the lid on, and allow it to rise until it crests 1" over the rim of the pan, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes with the lid on, then remove the lid and bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer, until the bread is golden brown and the interior registers 190°F on a digital thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool.  Yield: 1 loaf.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  If you don't have a long covered stoneware baker, form the dough into a log and place it on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Bake the bread on the baking sheet for a total of 35 to 45 minutes, until the interior registers 190°F on a digital thermometer.

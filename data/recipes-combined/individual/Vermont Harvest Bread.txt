Vermont Harvest Bread
    
    An autumn bread made with apple cider, toasted pumpkin seeds and walnuts, this loaf makes wonderful French toast.
    
     Dough  67g cornmeal 248g apple cider 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons instant yeast 46g olive oil (or flavored oil, if desired) 71g toasted pumpkin seeds 57g toasted walnuts 1/2 teaspoon curry powder, optional 57g maple syrup  Topping  1 egg white, lightly beaten 50g toasted pumpkin seeds 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients— by hand, mixer, or bread machine — kneading to form a smooth, supple dough.  If you're not using a bread machine, place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a proof cover, and allow the dough to rise for about 1 hour, or until it's puffy.  Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface. Shape it into a round, or oval; or divide it into three pieces, and braid it.  Brush the bread with a lightly beaten egg white. Coat the bread with the remaining pumpkin seeds.  Cover the loaf with a proof cover, or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow it to rise for about an hour; again, it won't rise much.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for about 35 to 45 minutes, loosely tenting it with aluminum foil if it appears to be browning too quickly. When the loaf is done, its internal temperature will be 190°F.  Remove the bread from the oven, and transfer it to a rack to cool.  The loaf may be stored well-wrapped at room temperature for 5 days or frozen for 3 months.

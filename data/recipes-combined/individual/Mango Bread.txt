Mango Bread
    
    This is a great loaf for those lingering hot summer days. It's high-rising, has a pretty golden color and moist texture, and a refreshing taste.
    
     Large 1 1/2-pound Loaf  331g puréed mango (about 1 large, ripe mango, peeled and puréed in a blender or food processor) 28g unsalted butter 21g granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 1/2 teaspoons Apple Pie Spice (or cinnamon) 14g vital wheat gluten 113g King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour 241g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons regular instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Basic White Bread, and press Start.  Check the dough after 10 to 15 minutes of kneading; it should have formed a smooth ball, soft but not sticky. If necessary, adjust the dough's consistency with additional flour or water.  Allow the machine to complete its cycle.   After loaf has cooled, store the bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.

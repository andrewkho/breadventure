banana health loaf

breads, low cal

1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour, divided
1/2 cup coconut, unsweetened shredd.
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup mashed banana (3 small)
3 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 tablespoon liquid honey

suggestion:  reserve 1/4 cup flour.  low fat recipes have a tendency
to be too dry.  bake about 35 min in 9x5 loaf pan or muffin cups if
8x4 pan not available.

mix together 1 1/4 c. of flour, coconut, baking powder, baking soda
and salt in a bowl.  combine banana, oil and honey.  stir into flour
mixture quickly but gently until just combined.  add part of the
remaining 1/4 cup flour if needed.  batter will be lumpy.

spread batter evenly in a lightly greased (and/or waxed paper lined)
8x4 loaf pan.  bake at 350 f about 45 min until tester inserted in
center comes out clean.  cool 10 min in pan. turn out of pan, cool
completely on rack. wrap in waxed paper and store overnight before
slicing.

makes 14 servings, each about 1/2 inch thick when 8x4 pan used. 1

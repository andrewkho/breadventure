Toast & Sandwich Bread
    
    Ah, sandwiches... the centerpiece of any picnic. Here's a moist, soft bread that's perfect for anything from pb&j to smoked salmon and capers.
    
       2 teaspoons instant yeast 25g sugar 227g lukewarm milk 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 361g  King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour  28g butter, melted 
    
     Directions   Combine all the ingredients and mix and knead — by hand, mixer, food processor, or bread machine — to make a soft, smooth dough.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and allow it to rise about 1 hour, or until it's puffy.  Shape the dough into a loaf, and place it in a greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.   Tent the dough with a proof cover or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow it to rise for about 1 hour, or until it's crowned 1" over the rim of the pan.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, or until it tests done (its internal temperature will read 190°F on an instant-read thermometer). Remove the bread from the pan to cool.  Store the bread, well-wrapped, on the counter for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

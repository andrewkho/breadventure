Parmesan Batter Bread
    
    Batter breads make a perfect accompaniment to soups. They're made with yeast, but are beaten rather than kneaded. Also, batter breads rise only once. They can be baked in any sized pan, but cast-iron skillets create a chewier crust.
    
       7g active dry yeast 57g lukewarm water (105°F to 115°F) 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 11g sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 113g butter, room temperature 113g lukewarm milk (105°F to 115°F) 1 large egg, beaten 50g shredded Parmesan cheese 85g cream cheese, cut in 1/2" dice 
    
     Directions   Stir yeast into the water to soften.   In a large bowl, whisk flour, sugar and salt together to combine.  Add softened yeast/water mixture to the dry ingredients, butter, milk, egg and Parmesan cheese. Beat mixture vigorously for 2 minutes.   Turn the batter into a well-seasoned 10" skillet or round pan. Dot top of dough with cream cheese.   Cover the pan with a greased piece of plastic and let rise for 1 hour.   Preheat the oven to 375°F.   Bake the bread for 20 minutes, or until its internal temperature reaches 190°F on an instant-read thermometer.  Store any leftover bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days.

place the oil in a bowl and spread a little of it on the palms of your
hands. knead the dough, gradually adding more oil until you have a
smooth, elastic ball. roll the ball of dough in the remaining oil to
cover all sides. place in a bowl, cover with a cloth, and allow to
stand in a warm place for about 2 hours.

divide the dough into 10 parts and roll to 1/4-inch thickness on a
pastry board dusted with cornstarch. cover with a cloth and let set

dough onto it. put your hands, palms down, under the dough and gently
stretch the dough with the backs of your hands, working your way
around the table until the dough is stretched as thin as tissue
paper. for moist filo, using scissors, cut dough immediately into
desired size pieces; if you prefer dry filo, allow it to stand for
about 10 minutes before cutting.

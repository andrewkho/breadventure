Sea Salt Bread
    
    This soft, flavorful bread is wonderful dipped into a soup, or served with an infused olive oil; try a few splashes of our garlic oil.
    
     Dough  340g lukewarm water 482g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 25g olive oil 2 teaspoons Maldon sea salt 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1/2 teaspoon salt  Topping  11g olive oil 1 teaspoon Maldon sea salt 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until it's smooth, soft, and slightly sticky, adding additional water or  flour as needed.  Place the kneaded dough in a greased bowl, cover the bowl, and let it rise at room temperature for about 1 hour, or until it's puffy (though not necessarily doubled in bulk).  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured or greased work surface. Press it gently a few times to deflate it, then place it on a lightly greased baking sheet.  Pat and stretch the dough into a 10" x 12" oval. If it fights back, allow it to rest for 30 minutes or so, covered, then pat it out to the full size.  Brush it with oil, then sprinkle with salt.  Cover the bread, and let it rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it's very puffy looking.  Preheat your oven to 400°F.  Just before baking, gently dimple the surface of the bread with your fingers.  Bake it in the preheated oven for 22 to 25 minutes, until it's golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and immediately transfer it to a rack to cool.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

Gluten-Free Apple Bread
    
    This is a loaf with so much flavor, folks won't know (or care) that it's gluten-free. If you choose to dress it up with raisins, nuts, or dried cranberries, add another 1/4 teaspoon xanthan gum. 
    
     Bread  266g King Arthur Gluten-Free Flour 99g sugar 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon xanthan gum 14g whole flax meal 1 tablespoon cinnamon 113g unsalted butter, softened 3 large eggs 1 tablespoon boiled cider or apple juice 283g peeled, cored, coarsely grated apple   Glaze  57g confectioners' sugar 14g to 28g heavy cream or milk 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan, a 12" x 4" tea loaf pan, or a pain de mie pan (you'll get a higher loaf in this one).  To make the bread: measure the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, xanthan gum, flax meal, and cinnamon into your mixing bowl.   Gradually add the butter, mixing at low speed. Mix until the butter is evenly dispersed and the mixture looks crumbly.   Add the eggs, boiled cider, and grated apple.   Beat the mixture at medium speed for 1 to 2 minutes, until the paddle or beaters leave some tracks in the batter. Scrape the bowl, mix for another 15 seconds, and transfer the batter to the prepared pan.  Smooth the top of the loaf with a spatula to make a pleasing shape. Bake the bread for 65 minutes; check the color of the top after 40 minutes and tent with foil if necessary.  When the center of the bread measures 210°F when measured with a digital thermometer, it's done. Remove the bread from the oven and place the pan on a rack to cool for 20 minutes, before tipping the bread out of the pan and returning it to the rack to cool completely.   To make the glaze: Combine all the ingredients until smooth; drizzle over the top of the cooled loaf.   Yield: 1 loaf, 16 slices.

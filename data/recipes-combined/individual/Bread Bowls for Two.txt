Bread Bowls for Two
    
    We're big fans of edible bread bowls; not only are they a tasty counterpart to whatever they contain, they minimize the amount of dishes in the sink once we're done eating!
    
     Starter  113g cool water 1/16 teaspoon instant yeast 120g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour  Dough  all of the starter (from above) 25g olive oil 113g lukewarm water 1 teaspoon salt 241g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast cornmeal for dusting 
    
     Directions   Note: Our apologies for the error in the original recipe; as of 12/24/13, the amount of water in the dough portion has been decreased from 1 1/2 cups to 1/2 cup.  To make the starter: Mix the water, yeast, and flour, stirring until the flour is incorporated. Cover and let rest at room temperature for about 14 hours, until bubbly.    To make the dough: Combine the starter with the remaining ingredients, and mix and knead by hand, mixer, or bread machine to make a soft, smooth dough.    Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 60 minutes.    Gently deflate the dough, divide it in half, and round each half into a ball.    Place each ball, seam side up, in a generously floured mini brotform. No brotform? Place the dough seam side down on a piece of parchment.    Cover and let rise until noticeably puffy, about 60 minutes.      Tip the loaves out of the brotform onto a cornmeal-dusted baker's peel or parchment, and transfer them to a pizza stone in a preheated 425Â°F oven.    Bake the loaves on the stone for 22 to 26 minutes, until they're golden brown. No pizza stone? Simply bake the loaves on a baking sheet.    To make bread bowls: Cut the top third off each loaf. Scoop out the insides, and fill with your favorite hearty soup or stew.    Yield: 2 bread bowls.

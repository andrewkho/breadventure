Pain Aux Noix
    
    Nut bread is the simple translation of pain aux noix, one of France's delightful whole-grain loaves. This golden, tender bread is fairly simple to make, but the texture and flavor are complex: oven heat brings out the walnuts' flavor, as well as the deep, rich taste of whole wheat. Serve this bread, thinly sliced, with a nice goat cheese, Roquefort, or a Brie or Camembert.
    
       57g unsalted butter, melted 283g King Arthur Premium Whole Wheat Flour or 100% White Whole Wheat Flour 177g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 11g brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons instant yeast 305g warm milk 170g chopped walnuts 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients except the nuts, and knead — by hand, mixer, food processor or bread machine — until smooth.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and let it rise, covered, for 1 hour, or until it's doubled in bulk.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface and gently but thoroughly knead in the walnuts. This will seem like messy work at first (the nuts will keep falling out onto the work surface), but persevere — eventually they'll stay where they belong.  Divide the dough in half, and shape each half into a ball. Place the balls on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, and let them rise, covered, for 45 minutes, until they're quite puffy, though not necessarily doubled in bulk.  Preheat the oven to 425°.  Bake for about 25 to 27 minutes, until it's golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads approximately 190°F.  Cool the loaves before slicing. Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

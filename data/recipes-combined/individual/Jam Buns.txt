Jam Buns
    
    These soft, golden puffs are served hot off the griddle, warm jam oozing from their centers.
    
       1/2 teaspoon salt 99g vegetable oil 340g milk 1 large egg 1 box King Arthur scone mix; Cream Tea is a good flavor choice 1/2 cup jam or jelly confectioners' sugar or cinnamon sugar, for topping 
    
     Directions   Whisk together the salt, oil, milk, and egg.  Add the dry mix, and stir just until the batter is evenly moist and thoroughly combined.  Place the jam bun (aebleskiver) pan on the stove. Allow it to preheat over medium heat for several minutes.  Grease each well of the pan by adding a dab of butter, or removing from the heat and spraying with non-stick spray.  Scoop about 1 tablespoon of batter into each of the wells.   Let the batter cook for about 2 minutes, then use a small spoon to place a dab of jam or jelly into the middle of the batter. The batter will rise over the jamadd a bit of extra batter if needed.   When the bottoms are set and golden brown, flip the buns overa table knife or chopstick works well here  Cook until the second side is also golden, an additional minute or two.  Remove from pan. Dust with confectioners' sugar or cinnamon-sugar, and serve warm.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  It's a good idea to bake one test bun first, in order to figure out exactly how hot you need the burner to be in order to cook the buns all the way through without burning them.

crusty corn bread

breads

1 cup flour
1 cup corn meal
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon baking powder
1  egg, lightly beaten
1 cup milk
1/4 cup cooking oil

combine the dry ingredients. combine the egg with the milk and oil.
stir into the mixture, mixing until *just* moistened. pour the
mixture into a preheated, lightly oiled, iron skillet until a little
more than half full. preheat the skillet by putting it into the oven
when the oven is turned on for preheating. gives a very crusty
cornbread with the top not cooked as dark as the sides and bottom.
bake at 425 degrees f. for maybe as much as 20 minutes.  cool
slightly and cut into squares, then serve warm. this is a trial and
error deal to suit your own taste for sweetness, adjust sugar as you
want, and crustiness.  don't want crust all over? then don't use
prehotted cast iron skillet, use 8 inch or 9 inch greased pie pan
instead. less crust?  experiment with preheating skillet on top of
stove to varying degrees, choose the one you like.

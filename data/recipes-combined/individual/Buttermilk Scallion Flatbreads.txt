Buttermilk Scallion Flatbreads
    
    This recipe won Jennifer Beckman of Falls Church, Virginia, a special award for "Best Recipe Using Whole Wheat Flour" at the National Festival of Breads. Combining a simple yogurt naan recipe with different herbs and dairy, Beckman landed on this formula, a family favorite. 
    
       113g warm water 1/2 teaspoon sugar 2 teaspoons active dry or instant yeast 340 to 369g King Arthur Premium Whole Wheat Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt 43g unsalted butter, melted 152g buttermilk, at room temperature 1 large egg 35g sliced scallions, green parts included peanut oil, for frying melted butter, for brushing 
    
     Directions   In a large bowl, whisk together the water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes for the yeast to start working.   Add 3 cups of the flour, the salt, melted butter, buttermilk, and egg. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes, scraping the bowl as needed.   Knead, in a stand mixer using a dough hook or by hand, for 2 to 3 minutes, until smooth and elastic, adding more flour as needed to form a soft dough that cleans the sides of the bowl. Knead the scallions into the dough. Place in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise for 30 to 40 minutes, until doubled.   Divide the dough into eight equal pieces. Shape each into a ball, then roll into 6" to 8" rounds about 1/4" thick.   Preheat a large skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium-low heat. Put 1 tablespoon of oil into the hot skillet and tilt to coat the bottom. Cook each round for 1 1/2 minutes on the first side, then flip and cook the second side until golden. Brush with melted butter before serving.   Store any leftovers, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.

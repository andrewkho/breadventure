Peanut Butter-Chocolate Loaf
    
    Two favorite flavors in a tasty yeast loaf.
    
     Dough  227g lukewarm water 135g peanut butter, smooth or crunchy 1 large egg 53g packed brown sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 7g instant yeast  Filling/Topping  128g chocolate chips 28g sparkling white sugar (optional) 
    
     Directions   Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.  Program the machine for 1 1/2-pound loaf, light crust setting, and press Start.  After about 10 minutes of kneading, check the dough; it should be soft and slightly sticky. Add a bit more flour or water, as necessary.  Add the chips with about 5 minutes left in the kneading cycle.  At the start of the final rise, spritz the loaf with water, and sprinkle it with sparkling white sugar.  Allow the machine to complete its cycle. Remove the bread from the pan, and cool it completely for easiest slicing.   Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

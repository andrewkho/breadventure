contributed to the echo by: michelle bass bread pudding combine all
ingredients; mixture should be very moist but not soupy. pour into
buttered 9x12' or larger baking dish. place into non-preheated oven.
bake at 350 degrees for approximately 1 hour and until top is golden
brown. serve warm with whiskey sauce (below).

whiskey sauce

cream butter and sugar over medium heat until all butter is absorbed.
remove from heat and blend in egg yolk. pour in bourbon gradually to
your own taste, stirring constantly. sauce will thicken as it cools.
serve warm over warm bread pudding.

note: for a variety of sauces, just substitute your favorite fruit
juice or liqueur to complement your bread pudding.

on a personal note, a lemon sauce or a hard sauce is great with bread
pudding too.

Herbed Texas Toast
    
    Don't mess with Texas — toast, that is. Double-thick slabs of bread, buttered and grilled, are just right for enormous sandwiches, chicken-fried steak or barbecue. 
    
       361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 7g Pizza Dough Flavor, optional 2 teaspoons Pizza Seasoning or mixed Italian herbs 227g milk 50g olive oil or garlic oil 74g water olive oil or garlic oil, extra for grilling 
    
     Directions   Combine the dry ingredients in a medium-sized mixing bowl.  Heat the milk, water and oil until lukewarm and add to the dry mixture.  Beat well, then stir in enough additional flour to make a stiff batter; the dough should be too slack to knead by hand, but stiff enough to hold its shape.  Spoon the batter into an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan. Cover the pan with a proof cover or lightly greased plastic wrap, and let the loaf rise in a warm place for 45 minutes, or until it's crowned over the top of the pan.  Bake the bread in a preheated 350°F oven for 35 minutes.  Remove it from the pan and cool before slicing.  Slice the bread about 3/4" thick, brush with olive oil or garlic oil, and grill — on your outdoor grill, or on a stovetop griddle.

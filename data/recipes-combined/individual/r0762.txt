dak's sourdough starter

breads

1 cup nonfat or lowfat milk
3 tablespoon unflavored yogurt (we used
1  nonfat)
1 cup all-purpose flour

in a 1-quart pan over medium heat, heat milk to 90-100 degrees.
remove from heat and stir in yogurt. place in a warm 3 to 6 cup
glass, ceramic, plastic or stainless steel container with a tight
lid. cover and let stand in a warm place until mixture is the
consistency of yogurt and a curd has formed. (you can test the
mixture by tilting the container. if the mixture doesn't flow freely
when the container is tilted, it's ready.) the curding process takes
about 18 to 24 hours. you'll need to check it periodically. if some
clear liquid rises to the top of the milk, stir it back in. note: if
the liquid turns pink, discard the batch and start again. once the
curd has formed, add the flour and stir until smooth. cover again and
let stand in a warm place until the mixture is full of bubbles and
has a good sour smell. this should take about 2 to 5 days. again, if
some clear liquid rises to the top stir it back in. if the liquid
turns pink, discard the batch and start again. when the mixture is
ready, you can keep it covered and store it in the refrigerator until
you need it. the recipe makes about
1 1/3    cup starter.

breads, main dish, ethnic

1 1/2 cup dried figs cut in small part
3 tablespoon butter
1 1/3 cup boiling water
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 each egg
1 tablespoon graded orange peel
1 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3 tablespoon dark jamaica rum
3/4 cup chopped walnuts

preheat oven to 350.  generously grease a 9 x 5 loaf pan for each
loaf. line bottom and sides of pan with waxed paper. combine figs,
sugar, butter and salt in large bowl of electric mixer. add boiling
water. let cool to room temperature (butter does not have to melt).
sift flour, baking soda and baking powder into medium bowl. add flour
mixture, egg, rum and orange peel to fig mixture and beat with
electric mixer at medium speed until well blended.  stir in nuts.
transfer batter to prepared pan, smoothing top. bake until tester
inserted in center comes out clean, about 65 to 75 minutes. let cool
in pan on rack 10 minutes.  remove loaf from pan and discard waxed
paper. let cool completely on rack. wrap airtight and let stand at
least 24 hours before serving. comments: really do let age before you
eat it;  much better on the second day. this really is tasty and is
hard not to snack away.

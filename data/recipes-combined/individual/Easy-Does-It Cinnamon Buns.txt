Easy-Does-It Cinnamon Buns
    
    These flat, dense cinnamon buns, the rich, deep color of cinnamon through and through, can be whipped up easily the night before, then left in the refrigerator overnight, ready to be baked the next morning — whatever the hour!
    
       85g butter, softened 248g granulated sugar 1 large egg 74g water 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon salt 14g baking powder 2 teaspoons cinnamon 43g raisins 25g brown sugar 
    
     Directions   Cream 2 tablespoons of butter with 2 tablespoons granulated sugar.  Beat in the egg and water.  Stir in the flour, salt, baking powder and cinnamon until you have a smooth dough.   On a floured work surface, roll dough into a 1/4" thick rectangle.  Spread the dough with more 2 tablespoons of butter. Sprinkle with 1/2 cup granulated sugar and raisins.  Starting with a long side, roll dough up jelly-roll fashion. Cut it in half to make two even log-shaped pieces, place pieces on a plate, and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Refrigerate overnight.   The next morning, remove the dough from refrigerator. Preheat the oven to 400°F.   Melt the remaining 2 tablespoons butter, stir in brown sugar, and pour the mixture into a round 9" or 10" cast iron skillet, or into a 9" x 9" pan, tilting to coat the entire bottom of pan.   Cut the dough into 1" slices and place, cut sides up, in the prepared pan.  Bake the cinnamon buns for 25 minutes, or until tops of buns are lightly browned.   Remove them from the oven and invert the pan onto serving dish. Wait a few seconds, then remove the pan.  Store any leftover cinnamon buns, covered, at room temperature for up to 5 days.

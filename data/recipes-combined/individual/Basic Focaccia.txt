Basic Focaccia
    
    In ancient Rome, panis focacius was a flatbread baked in the ashes of the hearth; the word "focus" refers to the hearth, or heart of the home, in Latin.The predecessor of pizza in Italy was a flat bread called "Focaccia" which is used both as an appetizer (an antipasto, the course before the pasta) or as an accompaniment to a main meal.
    
     Dough  227g water, warm 39g olive oil 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 2 teaspoons salt 14g Italian seasoning 2 teaspoons instant yeast or active dry yeast  Topping (optional)  39g olive oil 1 teaspoon salt 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead all of the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, bread machine or food processor — until you've made a smooth, elastic dough. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, turn to coat, cover, and allow it to rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until puffy.   Roll it out to form a rectangle, and transfer it to a cookie sheet, 10" x 15" to 12" x 18". Pat the dough into the pan. Make indentations in the dough with your fingertips, about an inch apart, and drizzle sparingly with olive oil. Sprinkle lightly with the salt.  Cover the focaccia loosely with greased plastic wrap, and let rise for 1/2 hour to 1 hour, or until puffy.  Preheat your oven to 450°F.  Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until lightly browned.  Store on the counter for 2 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  A plain focaccia can be topped with a light sprinkling of salt and pepper. Other toppings may include browned onions, fresh herbs and garlic, goat cheese, pesto, fresh sage and bacon, potatoes and rosemary, sun-dried tomatoes, Gorgonzola cheese, olives, or any combination of those or other ingredients of your choice.Leftover focaccia makes well-flavored croutons or turkey stuffing.

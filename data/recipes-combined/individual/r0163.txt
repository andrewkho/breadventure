basil-parmesan scones

appetizers, breads

1 recipe buttermilk bisquits
1/2 cup parmesan
1 tablespoon basil
1 dash garlic & onion
1  powder, black pepper

there's a bakery near me called aunt mary's (are you listening,
sallie?) and they have the most wonderful basil-parmesan scones. one
day i experimented and was pleased to find a pretty good facsimile.

just add the above ingredients along with all the other dry
ingredients and proceed as above.  these are a nice change of pace
from italian or garlic bread. or cut with smaller cutter and serve as
appetizer (don't forget to reduce baking time if smaller).

yield: 4 servings

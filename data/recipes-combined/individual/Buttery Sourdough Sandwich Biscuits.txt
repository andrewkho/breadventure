Buttery Sourdough Sandwich Biscuits
    
    These big, palm-sized biscuits are perfect for a breakfast sandwich. Their sourdough tang pairs nicely with egg, ham, sausage, or whatever you choose to stuff them with. Better yet — the recipe uses your "discard" sourdough, the extra starter you might otherwise throw away during the feeding process. 
    
       120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 113g cold unsalted butter 227g sourdough starter, unfed/discard* *See "tips," below. 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 425°F, with a rack in the upper third. Grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.   Combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Work the butter into the flour until the mixture is unevenly crumbly.   Add the starter, mixing gently until the dough is cohesive.   Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface (a piece of parchment works well), and gently pat it into a 1"-thick round.    Use a sharp 2 3/8" biscuit cutter to cut rounds, cutting them as close to one another as possible. Pat any scraps together, and cut additional biscuits.   Place the biscuits onto the prepared baking sheet, leaving about 2" between them; they'll spread as they bake.  Bake the biscuits in the upper third of your oven for 20 to 23 minutes, until they're golden brown.  Remove the biscuits from the oven, and serve warm. Or cool completely, wrap in plastic, and store at room temperature for several days. Freeze, well-wrapped, for longer storage.  Yield: 6 large (3") biscuits.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Sourdough starters can vary in how liquid they are. If your biscuit dough seems very dry, dribble in a bit of milk or buttermilk until it comes together.Feel free to make smaller biscuits, if desired; they'll need slightly less time in the oven than the larger biscuits.

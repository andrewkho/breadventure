1 pkg yeast
3 tablespoon ; water, warm
3/4 cup milk
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup shortening
1 teaspoon salt
1  egg; beaten
3 cup flour; divided
1  oil
1  sugar, confectioners; sifted

proof the yeast. scald the milk; stir in the sugar, shortening, and
salt. cook the mixture to the 105 to 115 degree range. add milk
mixture, egg, and 2 cups flour to the yeast mixture, mixing well.
gradually stir in enough remaining flour to make a soft dough. turn
the dough out onto a floured surface, and knead until smooth and
elastic (8 to 10 minutes). place in a well-greased bowl, turning to
grease the top. cover and let rise about 1 hour, or until doubled.
punch dough down; turn out onto a lightly floured surface. roll dough
into a 12" x 10" rectangle; cut into 2" squares. place on a floured
surface; cover and let rise in a warm place 30 minutes or until
doubled in bulk.

heat 3" to 4" of oil to 375 degrees; drop in 3 to 4 beignets at a
time. cook 1 minute on each side or until golden. drain on paper
towels, and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

     Directions   Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Get out a baking sheet, but don't grease it.    Cut the bread in slices about 1/3" thick. Spread each slice with a scant teaspoon of butter, and sprinkle with a light coating of sugar.  Place the slices on the baking sheet; they can be close together. Bake for 40 to 50 minutes, till fairly crisp. Remove from the oven, and cool on a rack. Crisps may still seem a bit soft when you take them out of the oven, but they should finish crisping as they cool.   Yield: about 18 to 24 crisps.

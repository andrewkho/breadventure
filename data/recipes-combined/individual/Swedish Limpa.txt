Swedish Limpa
    
    This orange- and spice-scented Swedish loaf is a favorite among Scandinavians. It's especially delightful toasted and spread with sweet butter.
    
       241g to 269g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 57g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 53g pumpernickel 78g dark corn syrup 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons caraway seeds 1 1/2 teaspoons anise seeds 1 1/2 teaspoons fennel seeds 1/4 teaspoon orange oil 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 227g to 283g water 57g butter or 50g vegetable oil 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients — by hand, mixer or bread machine — and knead  until the dough is smooth and satiny.   Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise for 1 hour. It'll become somewhat puffy, but probably won't double in bulk.  Shape the dough into a ball, flatten it slightly, and place it on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover with a dough rising cover or lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow it to rise for 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it's puffed up noticeably.  Bake the limpa in a preheated 350°F oven for 35 minutes, tenting it with aluminum foil for the final 10 minutes if it appears to be browning too fast.   Wrap and store at room temperature for up to a week, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Because this loaf has a tendency to spread as it rises and bakes, we like to cradle it in our cloche baker to ensure an even loaf. This also gives the bread a heartier crust. To make this bread in your cloche, allow the dough to go through its second rise in the cloche. Bake the loaf in a preheated 400°F oven for 35 to 45 minutes, remove the cover of the cloche, and continue to bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, until the top crust is golden brown.

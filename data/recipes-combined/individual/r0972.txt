breads, barry

1 lb white unbleached plain flour
4 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 pint warm water
1/2  dry yeast sachet
1 pinch sugar
1  rosemary or sage

mash the yeast with a little of the water until it looks like mud.
add the sugar and leave for 10 minutes until frothy.

put the rest of the water, the flour, a little of the salt and the
olive oil into a large bowl. when the yeast is frothy, add that too.
knead thoroughly for about 5 minutes. cover with a clean, damp tea
towel or cling film and leave it in the bowl in a warm place for
about 30 minutes. it will double in size.

take the dough out, put on a board, cut it in half and spread so you
have two dinner plate-sized pieces. sprinkle the rest of the salt
over the top, then add the rosemary or sage leaves, patting them into
the dough.

put the loaves into a hot oven, gas mark 7, 400f, 200c for about 20
minutes.

the bread will only rise marginally and will have a lovely pale
golden top.

the one that native indians used long before the white man came to
the caribou.*

same ingredients.  put in bowl and mix with hands until thoroughly
combined. work with dough until it feels soft and satiny, about 3-5
minutes.  take handful of dough and pat between palms until you get a
saucer sized form. wrap around sturdy stick and cook over open camp
fire until golden brown. can be eaten alone, broken in pieces and
buttered and jammed, or if you want to get fancy, stuff with cooked
ground beef mixture. the best way to eat it is at night when the kids
have gone to bed, and you are sitting around the campfire swapping
horror stories. eat it plain, it is fantastic.

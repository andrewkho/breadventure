farinata (chick pea bake)

breads, italian, argentinian

6 1/4 cup water
4 cup garbanzo (chick pea) flour
1  salt; to taste
8 tablespoon olive oil; or corn oil
1 large onion, sliced (optional)
1  freshly ground black pepper

this italian dish is also popular in argentina.  they call it faina'
and it is sometimes prepared with onion slices as a topping. a plain
faina' slice is often used to top a pizza slice, sandwich-style.

pour the water into a large heavy pan, then gradually stir in the
flour. add salt to taste.  cook over gentle heat for 1 hour, stirring
frequently and skimming the surface with a slotted spoon
occasionally; the mixture should be smooth and quite thick.

pour the mixture into an oiled roasting pan (preferably a pizza pan)
and level the surface. sprinkle the oil over the surface, and arrange
the onion rings on top, if used.

bake in a moderately hot oven (400 f / 200 c) for 30 minutes until
golden brown.  sprinkle liberally with pepper and serve immediately.

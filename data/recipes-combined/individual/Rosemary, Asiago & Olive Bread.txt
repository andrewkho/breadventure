Rosemary, Asiago & Olive Bread
    
    Paired with a simple tomato or vegetable soup, this rich and savory quick bread (no yeast!) makes a hearty fall lunch. 
    
       241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 142g semolina flour 28g buttermilk powder 28g Vermont cheese powder 2 teaspoons baking powder   1 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons fresh or dried rosemary, snipped into small pieces 113g grated Asiago cheese or sharp cheddar cheese, plus 1 ounce for garnish 14g fresh parsley, cilantro, or green onion (1 ounce), finely chopped 156g olives, drained and chopped (black, green, or a combination) 340g milk 99g olive oil 2 large eggs 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan, or smaller pans of your choice (see tip at right).  Whisk the dry ingredients in a bowl until well blended.   Toss in the cheese, herbs or onion, and olives.  In a separate bowl, whisk the milk, oil, and eggs until foamy.   Stir the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture.  Spoon the batter into the prepared pan. Sprinkle with 1/4 cup grated cheese.  Bake the bread for 55 to 60 minutes (30 to 35 for mini loaves), until a tester inserted into the middle of the loaf comes out clean.  Remove it from the oven, and after 10 minutes turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool.  Yield: one 9" x 5" loaf.

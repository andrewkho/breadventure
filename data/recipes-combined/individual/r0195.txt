breads

1/4 cup butter
1 1/2 cup unsifted flour
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar
1 large egg
1/2 cup milk
1 cup fresh cranberries
2 tablespoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

stir flour to aerate.  mix the 2 tablespoons sugar with cinnamon.
coarsely chop cranberries with knife.

generously butter a 12 cup muffin pan.

in a small saucepan or skillet, melt butter; set aside to cool.

in a medium mixing bowl, with a fork, thoroughly stir together the
flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.

in a small mixing bowl beat egg enough to combine yolk and white;
beat in milk and melted butter.  add to flour mixture; stir quickly
and lightly just until flour is almost dampened. add cranberries;
lightly stir in; do not beat.

using a large metal spoon, spoon batter into prepared muffin-pan
cups, filling each slightly more than half full. sprinkle 1/2 teaspoon
cinnamon-sugar over batter in each cup.

bake in a preheated 375~ oven until golden brown and a cake tester
inserted in the center comes out clean - 20 to 25 minutes.

if muffins are to be held 10 to 15 minutes before serving, tip them
in the pan to prevent steaming and keep in a warm oven. to reheat
cold muffins, place them in a covered pan or a closed paper bag in a
preheated 350~ oven for 10 minutes.

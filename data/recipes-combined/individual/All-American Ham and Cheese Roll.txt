All-American Ham and Cheese Roll
    
    Looking for a sandwich you can grab and eat with one hand, WITHOUT the filling sliding out? You've found it. Ham and cheese are rolled in a sheet of yeast dough and baked, yielding a stuffed sandwich that's a treat to eat.
    
     Crust  361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 11g sugar 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 11g potato flour 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1 tablespoon Pizza Dough Flavor 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 227g lukewarm water  Filling  mustard 1/2 pound thin-sliced ham 1/2 pound thin-sliced Swiss, Muenster, or American cheese (or the cheese of your choice) 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough. Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 hour.  Roll the dough into a 12" x 18" rectangle.   Brush all over with mustard, leaving a 1" mustard-free zone all around the edge.  Add the cheese in a single layer, then the ham; again, leave the border bare.  Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into an 18" log. Pinch the long seam closed, then fold the ends over and pinch them closed, too.  Curve the log into a horseshoe shape on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, seam-side down.  Cover the sheet, and allow the roll to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours; it should look puffy, though not doubled. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Slash the roll crosswise, about 1/2" deep, at 3" to 4" intervals along its length. There's no need to use a knife for this; making snips with a pair of scissors works just as well.   Bake the roll for 35 minutes, until it's golden brown, tenting it lightly with foil if it appears to be browning too quickly. Remove it from the oven, and allow it to cool for 20 minutes before serving.

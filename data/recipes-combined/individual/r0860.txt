breads

1/2 cup raisins
1/2 cup mixed candied fruit; chopped
2 tablespoon brandy
3 cup flour; to 3-1/2 c
3/4 cup sugar
3/4 cup almonds, ground
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon cardamon, ground
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg, ground
1/2 cup butter
1 cup farmer cheese (or cottage cheese)
2  egg; slightly beaten
1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
1/2 cup walnuts; chopped
2 tablespoon butter; melted
1 1/2 cup sugar, confectioners
2 tablespoon milk
1  candied cherries
1  whole almonds

combine the raisins, mixed candied fruit and brandy; let stand at room
temperature for an hour. combine the next eight ingredients. cut in
the butter with a pastry blender or food processor until the mixture
resembles coarse meal. process the farmer cheese in a food processor
or blender until smooth. add the cottage cheese, eggs, vanilla,
raisin mixture, and walnuts to the dry ingredients, stirring until
moistened. shape the dough into a ball.

turn the dough out on a floured surface, and knead until smooth (one
to two minutes), adding more flour if necessary. roll dough to form
an oval about 12" x 8-1/2". brush the dough with a tablespoon of the
melted butter. fold the long side of the dough over to within about
an inch and a half of the opposite side. place on baking sheet lined
with parchment. bake at 350 f. for 40 to 45 minutes or until the loaf
is lightly browned. brush with the remaining melted butter. transfer
the stollen to wire rack to cool. combine the confectioners' sugar
and milk, stirring until smooth. drizzle over the cooled bread.
garnish with candied cherries and almonds.

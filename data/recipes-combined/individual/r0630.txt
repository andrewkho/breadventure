corn sticks

breads, southern

2  eggs
2 cup buttermilk
1 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon soda
2 cup sifted white corn meal
3 tablespoon melted shortening
1 teaspoon salt
3 teaspoon baking powder

beat eggs together until light.  add milk, shortening and salt.  add
meal, being careful in putting in, as meal varies and the batter
should be a medium batter.  beat smooth.  grease and heat stick pans.
sift in the baking powder and dissolve the soda in a spoonful of cold
water. add to the mixture, stir well and pour into molds.  bake in
good hot oven until brown and crusty--about 15 to 20 minutes.  corn
sticks need a batter some thinner than muffins.

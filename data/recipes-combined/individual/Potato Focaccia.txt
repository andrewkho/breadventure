Potato Focaccia
    
    This substantial savory flatbread, with its soft, porous texture, teams well with soup or stew.
    
     Sponge  120g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 60g potato flour 1 teaspoon instant yeast 283g water  Dough  241g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 25g olive oil 78g "french-fried" onions olive oil, for greasing the pan  Topping  2 cloves crushed garlic 21g olive oil 2 teaspoons salt 680g large potatoes olive oil, for greasing the pan 
    
     Directions   To make the sponge: By hand, mixer, or bread machine, mix together the bread flour, the potato flour, yeast and water and let rest, covered, for 1 hour.  To make the dough: Add the flour, 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 2 tablespoons olive oil, kneading the dough until it's shiny and elastic.  Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it, and allow it to rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until doubled in bulk.   Lightly oil a 12" round pan.  Working with lightly greased hands (the dough is somewhat sticky), turn the dough out onto the pan. Pat and push the dough to the edges of the pan, sprinkle with the onions, cover, and let rise while you're preparing the topping.   To make the topping: While the focaccia is rising, mix the garlic, oil, and the remaining 2 teaspoons of salt together in a large bowl.  Slice the potatoes as thinly as possible (a mandoline is a great help), and toss the potato slices in the oil mixture.  Using a small amount of olive oil in a 12" round frying pan, layer the potatoes and press down. Let them cook for 10 minutes without turning; they'll become crisp, and will stick together in a "cake."  While you're cooking the potatoes, preheat the oven to 375Â°F.  Let the potatoes cool for a few minutes, then flip the potato "cake" onto the top of the dough. Bake the focaccia for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the crust is a deep, golden brown.   Store, covered, for 2 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

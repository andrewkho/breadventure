currant scones

breads, fruits

2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
6 oz butter; very soft
3 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup currants
2  eggs; lightly beaten
1/3 cup milk; or sour cream

sift together  flour, baking powder and salt into a large bowl. break
butter into 1 oz pieces and scatter into flour. for the lightest
scones, don't pinch the butter and flour together as when making
biscuits. scoop up a handful of flour and butter and very, very
lightly run your thumb across your fingers, allowing the flour to
sift through. at first, it will seem as if nothing is happening, but
within 2 minutes the mixture will resemble fine crumbs.

add sugar, currants and eggs. lightly fold into the flour mixture
with your hands. start with about 1/4 cup milk and add a bit at a
time, folding and mixing to make a soft dough. turn the dough out
onto a lightly floured board. do not knead; just pat it out into a
rectangle about 1" thick. cut it into 2" diamonds or squares. put the
scones on a lightly greased baking sheet. bake at 425f for 10
minutes, or until lightly browned and puffed.

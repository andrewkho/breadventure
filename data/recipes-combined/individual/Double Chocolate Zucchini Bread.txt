Double Chocolate Zucchini Bread
    
    Moist, dense, and super chocolate-y, no one will ever guess there's zucchini in this bread. What a great way to use up some of your excess harvest!
    
       2 large eggs 113g honey 99g vegetable oil 106g brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon espresso powder, optional 28g King Arthur Triple Cocoa Blend or Dutch-process cocoa 202g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 340g shredded, unpeeled zucchini  170g chocolate chips 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F; lightly grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.    In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, honey, oil, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.   Add the salt, baking soda, baking powder, espresso powder, cocoa, and flour, mixing until well combined.   Stir in the zucchini and chocolate chips.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake the bread for 65 to 75 minutes, until the loaf tests done (a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean, save for perhaps a light smear of chocolate from the melted chips).   Remove the bread from the oven, and let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes before turning it out of the pan onto a rack.   Cool completely before slicing; store well-wrapped, at room temperature.  Yield: one 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf.

Za'atar Monkey Bread with Garlic and Onion Labneh
    
    These fluffy herbed balls of bread come courtesy of blogger Molly Yeh and her book, Molly on the Range. They're both comforting and delightful, almost like a savory doughnut hole. A heaping pile of garlic and onions is folded into labneh for a dip that's reminiscent of the onion-y chip dip of your youth. 
    
     Bread  1 batch  Molly's Basic Challah, prepared through the first rise 28g unsalted butter, melted 89g za'atar spice blend   Garlic and onion labneh  227g labneh or whole-milk plain Greek yogurt 4 cloves garlic, peeled and minced 64g finely chopped red onion 1/4 teaspoon ground sumac, optional kosher salt black pepper olive oil, for drizzling 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 375°F. Grease a 12-cup Bundt or tube pan.   To make the bread: Divide and roll the dough into 24 golf ball-sized pieces. Dip them in the melted butter and roll in the za'atar to coat evenly, then pile them into the prepared pan. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.   Uncover the bread and bake it for 30 to 40 minutes, until its internal temperature reaches 190°F. Begin checking for doneness at 30 minutes. Let cool for 20 minutes in the pan on a rack, then tilt the bread out of the pan onto the rack to cool a bit more before serving.   To make the labneh: In a medium bowl, combine the labneh, garlic, onion, sumac (if using), and a sprinkling of salt and pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and serve with the monkey bread.   Store any bread leftovers at room temperature, well wrapped, for several days. Freeze for longer storage. Refrigerate labneh in an airtight container for up to a week.

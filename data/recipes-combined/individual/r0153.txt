basic sourdough starter (with potato)

breads

1 large baking potato peeled, cubed
1 cup white flour
1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar

cook potato in water to cover until tender. pour off liquid to
measure 1 c, saving potato for other use. let potato water cook to
lukewarm. in a glass or ceramic bowl that has been scalded, place
flour, yeast and sugar; add lukewarm potato water and stir in well.
cover with plastic wrap and pierce with fork to release gases. place
in a warm, draft-free location at an even 85f for 2 days; stir
several times daily. (do not let sourdough starter rise above 95f
because higher temp are favorable to less desireable microorganisms)
refrigerate until ready to use. replenish with one c flour and 3/4 c
water and let stand overnight or 12 hrs in a warm location before
refrigerating again. when replenishing, add lukewarm water with
flour. starter should be at room temp when using in recipes, always
after having stood 12 hrs from addition of replenishing flour and
water. at least 1 c should remain to refrigerate.

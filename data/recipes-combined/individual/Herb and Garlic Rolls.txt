Herb and Garlic Rolls
    
    Wonderfully tasty rolls made with our easy Herb and Garlic Artisan Blend. 
    
       2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 454g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 57g Herb and Garlic Artisan Blend 283g lukewarm water 25g olive oil 
    
     Directions   Combine all the ingredients, and mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.   Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Or, let the dough go through its first rise in the bread machine.   Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface and deflate it gently.    Divide the dough into 16 pieces, and roll each piece into a tight ball.    Place the balls in two lightly greased 8" round pans — 8 rolls in each. Cover the rolls and let them rise until not quite doubled in size, about 45 minutes.   Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 400°F.   Bake the rolls for 20 to 22 minutes, until golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and after 5 minutes transfer them from the pan onto a rack to cool.   Yield: 16 rolls.   
    
     Tips from our bakers  To make a sandwich loaf, shape the dough into a 9" log, and place it in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan. Let rise and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown. Its internal temperature should register 190°F on an instant-read thermometer.

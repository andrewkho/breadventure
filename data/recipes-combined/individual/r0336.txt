6 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 cup butter or regular margarine
2 each eggs; lg
1 cup water
4 cup unbleached flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

thinly peel the oranges, using a vegetable peeler. cut the orange
rind into thin slivers. (reserve the oranges for another use, or eat
them and enjoy.) combine the orange rind and 1 cup of water in a 2
quart saucepan and bring to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and
simmer for 15 minutes or until the rind is tender. add the 1 cup of
sugar and continue cooking, uncovered, until the mixture is syrupy,
about 15 minutes. cool to room temperature. meanwhile, sift the
flour, baking powder and salt together in a bowl and set aside.
cream the butter and 1/2 cup of sugar together until light and
fluffy, using a electric mixer set on medium. add the eggs and blend
well. blend in the cooled orange rind mixture. add the dry ingredients
alternately with the milk to the creamed mixture, beating well after
each addition. pour the batter into 2 greased 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf
pans. bake in a preheated 350 degree f. oven for 50 minutes or until
a cake tester or wooden pick inserted in the center comes out clean.
cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to wire racks to
finish cooling. wrap in aluminum foil and let stand overnight before
slicing. this bread slices better when it has cooled for 24 hours.

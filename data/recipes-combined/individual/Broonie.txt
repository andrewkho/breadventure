Broonie
    
    This moist, "tweedy" loaf is descended from a traditional Scottish oatmeal gingerbread. It's equally delicious with a scoop of ice cream after dinner, or paired with jam and yogurt for breakfast.
    
       149g old-fashioned rolled oats 113g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 106g brown sugar, packed 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 1/2 teaspoons ground ginger 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 113g cold unsalted butter 3 large eggs 85g molasses 227g buttermilk 92g diced crystallized ginger 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.   In a large bowl, whisk together the oats, flours, sugar, salt, ground ginger, and baking powder. Work in the butter, mixing until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal.  In a separate bowl, combine the eggs, molasses, and buttermilk. Add this mixture to the dry ingredients, stirring until the batter is evenly moistened. Stir in the diced ginger. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake the bread for 65 to 70 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean. Remove it from the oven and cool on a rack.   Once the loaf is cool, turn it out of the pan and wrap well; it's best to wait overnight before slicing.

Bagel Buns
    
    These chewy buns, studded with bits of cheese, are great for sturdy sandwiches or soup dinners.
    
     Dough  1 teaspoon instant yeast 25g non-diastatic malt powder 482g High Gluten Flour or organic high-gluten flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 340g water 113g Asiago, Gruyère or Swiss cheese, cut into 1/4" dice or smaller  Glaze  25g non-diastatic malt powder 57g water 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients except the cheese, and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a very soft, smooth dough. Knead the cheese in at the end.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, until puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Divide it into 10 equal pieces, and round each piece into a ball.  Cover the balls lightly, and let them rest for 15 minutes.   Shape the bagels by poking your index finger through the center of each ball, then twirling the ball until the hole's about 2" in diameter.  Place the bagels on a parchment-lined baking sheet, cover them, and allow them to rise for 1 hour, or until they begin to look puffy.  Mix together the malt and water, and brush the buns with the mixture. Let the buns rest, uncovered, for 15 minutes.  Preheat your oven to 400°F.  Brush the buns with the malt water again, put them in the oven, then brush them a third time after baking for 10 minutes.  Bake the buns for 12 to 15 minutes longer, until they're a deep, golden brown.  Remove them from the oven, and cool on a wire rack.  Store, wrapped, at room temperature for 3 days or freeze for up to a month.

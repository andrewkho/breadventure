2 teaspoon melted butter

yeast is dissolved. add cooled milk mixture to yeast mixture in
mixing bowl. stir in egg substitute, vanilla and salt.  beat in 1 cup
flour. beat in enough remaining flour to make soft dough. 	knead
about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. put dough into greased
bowl. let rise in warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.
	sprinkle 2 tablespoons sugar over chopped cranberries.  let stand
while bread rises. drain excess liquid off cranberries.  knead
cranberries into dough. shape into round. spray baking sheet with
non-stick cooking spray, or grease lightly. place dough round on
baking sheet. cover and let rise until doubled, about 45 minutes.
brush top of bread with butter. sprinkle with remaining 1/2
tablespoon sugar. bake at 375 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes, until
golden brown. let cool to warm. makes 8 servings.

notes:

1. it is important to let the milk and sugar mixture cool completely
before adding it to the yeast.  or else you will kill the yeast and
end up with flat bread.

2. if after draining the liquid from the cranberries and kneading in
the dough is moist and sticky, just add a little more flour.

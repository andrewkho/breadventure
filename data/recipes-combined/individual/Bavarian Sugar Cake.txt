Bavarian Sugar Cake
    
    The following cinnamon-y, velvety yeast "cake" is drizzled with cream and sugar before baking — fattening but tasty. This cake isn't cloyingly sweet, but is very tender. Serve it with coffee, at breakfast or as a mid-morning or mid-afternoon pick-me-up.
    
     Dough  113g whole milk 113g water 1 large egg 1 teaspoon almond extract 57g unsalted butter 74g sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 14g SAF Gold instant yeast  Glaze  74g sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 227g heavy cream 
    
     Directions   Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for the dough or manual cycle, and press start.  Check the dough with about 10 minutes remaining in the final kneading cycle, and adjust the consistency by adding flour or water as needed. The dough should be fairly sticky and slack.  When the machine has completed its cycle, remove the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured work surface.  Grease a 9" x 13" pan. Press the dough into the prepared pan with your fingers, stretching it to cover the bottom of the pan.  Cover the pan with plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise until it's doubled in bulk, 30 to 45 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  With two fingers, punch deep holes all over the dough.  In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle it over the dough.   Drizzle the cream evenly on top.  Bake the cake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.   Remove the cake from the oven, and serve it warm from the pan.  Store the cake, covered, at room temperature for 5 days or in the freezer for a month.

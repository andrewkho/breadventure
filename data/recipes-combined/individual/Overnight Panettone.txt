Overnight Panettone
    
    This traditional Italian holiday bread will stay fresh longer when it's made with an overnight starter.
    
     Starter  85g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1/16 teaspoon (just a pinch) instant yeast 74g cool water  Dough  all of the starter (above) 269g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 57g lukewarm water 2 large eggs 57g softened butter 1/2 teaspoon Fiori di Sicilia flavoring OR 1 teaspoon vanilla + 1/8 teaspoon orange oil 2 1/4 teaspoons SAF Gold instant yeast OR 1 tablespoon instant yeast 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 67g sugar 85g golden raisins 64g slivered dried apricots 85g dried cranberries 71g chopped dried pineapple 2 tablespoons grated orange rind or grated lemon rind (zest) 
    
     Directions   To make the starter: Combine the starter ingredients in a medium-sized mixing bowl, cover, and allow them to rest overnight (8 to 12 hours).  To make the dough: Combine all of the dough ingredients except the fruit and zest, and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.   Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it's puffy (though not necessarily doubled in bulk).   Gently deflate the dough, and knead in the fruits and zest.  Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a panettone pan or other straight-sided, tall 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan. Cover the pan and let the dough rise until it's just crested over the rim of the pan, about 1 hour.   Bake the bread in a preheated 400°F oven for 10 minutes; reduce the oven heat to 375°F and bake an additional 10 minutes; then reduce the heat to 350°F and bake for 25 minutes, tenting with aluminum foil if the crust appears to be browning too quickly.  Remove the panettone from the oven and cool completely. Store at room temperature, well-wrapped, for up to a week; freeze for longer storage.

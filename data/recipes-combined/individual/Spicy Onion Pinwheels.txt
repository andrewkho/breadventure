Spicy Onion Pinwheels
    
    A burger is an opportunity to play with toppings, cheeses and sauces, but so often they're served on a basic white roll. Slightly spicy onion rolls add a new dimension of flavor and interest to an already creative burger.
    
     Dough  227g water 11g sugar 1 teaspoon salt 14g butter, 14g margarine, or 11g vegetable oil 7g Bakers' Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 large egg 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast  Filling  71g french-fried onions 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper 
    
     Directions   Place all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine according to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Program the machine for Dough or Manual cycle and press Start.   Check the dough's consistency about 7 minutes after the kneading cycle begins, adding additional water or flour to form a soft, smooth dough.  When the cycle is complete, transfer the dough to a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface.  Roll it into a 16" x 10" rectangle.  Combine the french-fried onions and the crushed red pepper, and evenly spread this filling over the dough, leaving a 1" border on each long edge of the dough.   Starting with a long edge, roll the dough into a log, pinching the seams together well.   Using a serrated knife, cut the log into 1" slices.  Place the rolls about 2" apart on a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet.  Let them rise, covered, for about 30 minutes.   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.  Bake the rolls for about 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown.   Remove them from the oven, and cool them completely before serving.  Store the rolls, well-wrapped, for up to 5 days at room temperature or up to a month in the freezer.

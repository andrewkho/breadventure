     Directions   Grease a 10‚Äù diameter monkey bread pan  or ring pan.  For the cake, combine 3/4 cup (3 ounces) of the flour, the yeast, sugar, and salt.   Combine the warm milk and melted butter, and gradually add to the flour mixture, mixing for 2 minutes.   Add the eggs, the remaining 1 1/2 cups (6 1/4 ounces) of the flour, and the zest. Beat vigorously for 2 minutes.   Spread the dough evenly into the pan. Cover, and let rise for 1 hour. Towards the end of the cake's rising time, preheat the oven to 375?F.  For the syrup, combine the sugar and water in a saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Simmer for about 10 minutes, until the syrup thickens.   Add the lemon juice, and remove from the heat.  Bake the cake for 22 to 25 minutes, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Remove it from the oven.  Brush half the syrup over the cake, and allow it to cool for 5 minutes.   Turn the cake out onto a rack set over parchment or a pan. Brush the remaining syrup over the newly exposed bottom crust.   Turn the cake right-side up onto a plate, and cool completely. Serve with whipped cream and berries.  Yield: one 10" cake.

boil the potatoes in their jackets, pull off the skins and mash
straight away.

add the egg, butter, flour and herbs (if using) and mix well. season
with plenty of salt and pepper, adding a few drops of creamy milk if
the mixture is too stiff.

shape into a 1" round and then cut into eight pieces. dip in seasoned
flour.

bake on a griddle over an open fire or fry in bacon fat or melted
butter on a gentle heat. cook the fadge until crusty and golden on
one side, then flip over and cook on the other side (about 4-5
minutes on each side).

serve on its own on hot plates with a blob of butter melting on top.

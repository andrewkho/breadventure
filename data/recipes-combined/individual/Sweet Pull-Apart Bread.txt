Sweet Pull-Apart Bread
    
    This coffeecake-like loaf (a.k.a. monkey bread) is a fun weekend treat â€” each person can "grab and go" as they cycle through the kitchen at breakfast-time.
    
     Dough  361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 50g sugar 2 teaspoons instant yeast 57g butter 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 227g milk 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon rum extract (optional)   Topping  57g butter, melted 142g light brown sugar 7g cinnamon 
    
     Directions   Place all of the dough ingredients into the bucket of your bread machine. Program the machine for dough, and press Start.  After about 10 minutes of kneading, check the dough's consistency; it should be smooth and very soft, though it should form a ball and clean the bottom and sides of the bucket.  Adjust its consistency with additional flour or water, if necessary, and allow the machine to complete its cycle.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, and divide it into 32 small pieces, each about 1 1/2" in diameter.  Whisk together the brown sugar and cinnamon. Dip the balls in the melted butter, roll them in the cinnamon-sugar, and layer them in the bucket.   Place the bucket in the machine, close the lid, and allow the bread to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.   Program the machine for bake only, 65 minutes, light crust, and press Start. When the cycle is complete, let the bread stand for a few minutes, then remove the bucket and turn the bread out onto a serving platter.

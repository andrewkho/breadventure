     Dough  21g minced dried onions 340g lukewarm water 25g vegetable oil 298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 135g pumpernickel flour 1 tablespoon King Arthur Whole-Grain Bread Improver OR vital wheat gluten 2 teaspoons Deli Rye Flavor, optional but delicious  2 teaspoons instant yeast  1 1/2 teaspoons salt   Topping  28g Everything Bread and Bagel Topping, or poppy seeds 
    
     Directions   Soften the dried onions in the water for 30 minutes or so.   Add the remaining dough ingredients, and mix and knead by hand, mixer, or bread machine, until you've made a slightly sticky, shiny dough.  Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot for 45 minutes to 1 1/2 hours, until almost doubled.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased or floured work surface and divide it into 12 pieces.   Roll each piece into a ball, and dip the tops into seeds. If the dough is dry, spritz with water and sprinkle with seeds.   Cover and let rise 30 minutes to 1 hour, until almost doubled in size. Preheat the oven to 375°F while the rolls are rising.  Bake the rolls for 15 to 20 minutes, until they sound hollow when tapped and feel firm to the touch; their internal temperature should be at least 190°F.   Remove the rolls from the oven, and cool on a rack. Store cooled rolls wrapped in plastic, at room temperature.   Yield: 12 rolls.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  For deeper color, add 1 tablespoon cocoa powder to the dough along with the flours.

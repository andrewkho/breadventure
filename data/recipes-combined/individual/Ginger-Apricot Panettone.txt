Ginger-Apricot Panettone
    
    This Italian holiday bread will stay fresh longer when it's made with an overnight starter. We love substituting ginger and apricot for the more traditional candied peel.
    
     Starter  120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1/16 teaspoon yeast 113g cool water  Dough  all of the starter 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 28g potato flour 57g lukewarm water 2 large eggs 85g (3/4 stick) unsalted butter 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1/4 teaspoon Fiori di Sicilia flavoring 50g sugar 128g chopped dried apricots 50g diced crystallized ginger 
    
     Directions   Combine the starter ingredients in a medium-sized mixing bowl, cover, and allow them to rest overnight (8 to 12 hours at room temperature).  Combine the starter with the remainder of the dough ingredients (except the fruit), and mix and knead them togetherby hand, mixer or bread machinetill you've made a soft, sticky dough.   Knead in the ginger and apricots.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it's puffy (though not necessarily doubled in bulk).  Gently deflate the dough, and shape it into a ball.  Place it in a panettone pan or other straight-sided, tall 1 1/2- to 2-quart pan.  Cover the pan and let the dough rise till it's just crested over the rim of the pan, about 1 hour. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake the bread for 15 minutes; reduce the oven heat to 350°F and bake for an additional 35 minutes, tenting with aluminum foil if the crust appears to be browning too quickly.  Remove the panettone from the oven and cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar, if desired.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  To make Citrus Panettone, replace the apricot and ginger with 1 cup (6 ounces) of your favorite candied peel.  For individual panettones made in our bake-and-give papers, after the first rise, divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Bake individual panettones at 375°F for 15 minutes, and at 350°F for another 8 to 10 minutes.

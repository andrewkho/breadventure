1 tablespoon butter or margarine, melted

makes 3 loaves.

in a large glass, stoneware or plastic bowl, using a wooden spoon,
stir together starter, 2 cups warm water and 2 1/2 cups flour until
well blended.  cover loosely with plastic wrap. let stand in a warm
place (85 f) at least 12 hours.

in a small bowl, sprinkle yeast over 1/4 c warm water; stir until
dissolved.

in a 2-qt saucepan over low heat, heat milk, sugar, salt and 3 tbsp
butter until warm (105 - 115 f). remove from heat, stir in yeast
mixture.

stir yeast mixture into starter mixture.  stir in 2 1/2 cups flour
until well blended.  cover loosly with plastic wrap. let rise in a
warm place until almost doubled, about 45 minutes to one hour.

stir down batter, gradually stir in enough additional flour to make a
soft dough,  turn out dough onto lightly floured surface, knead until
smooth and elastic, about 5 to 7 minutes.

divide dough into thirds, cover and let rest 10 minutes.

shape each third into a loaf.  place each into a greased 8 1/2 x 4
1/2 x 2 1/2 loaf pan.  cover and let rise until doubled, about 45
minutes to one hour.

bake in 375 f oven 40 minutes, or until loaves are golden brown and
sound hollow when tapped. immediately remove from pans. brush tops of
hot loaves with melted butter.  cool on racks.

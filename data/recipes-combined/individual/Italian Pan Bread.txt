Italian Pan Bread
    
    Semolina gives this crusty-chewy bread its beautiful golden hue.
    
       340g lukewarm water 298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 248g semolina 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 7g Pizza Dough Flavor, optional 25g olive oil, plus more to drizzle over dough sea salt, kosher salt, and/or pizza seasoning, to top dough 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, and mix and knead them to form a smooth, slightly sticky dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 1/2 hours, or until it's about doubled in bulk.  Coat the inside of a 9" x 13" baking dish heavily with olive oil.  Turn the dough out onto a greased work surface and fold it over several times to gently deflate it.  Pat the dough into the bottom of the pan, and set it aside to rise for an hour or so, covered, until it's puffy.  Towards the end of the rising time, preheat your oven to 425°F.  Brush the dough with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and herbs, if desired. Gently but firmly dimple it, pressing your fingers almost to the bottom of the pan.  Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes, until it's a deep golden brown.  Remove from the oven, and transfer from the pan to a rack to keep the bottom crisp. Cut in squares to serve.  Store, well-wrapped, for 4 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  To serve with fondue: Bake the squares in a preheated 350°F oven until warm and slightly crisp, about 10 minutes.

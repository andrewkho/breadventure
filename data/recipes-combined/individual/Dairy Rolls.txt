Dairy Rolls
    
    These golden rolls, with their mild cheese flavor, are wonderful for sandwiches.
    
       298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 82g semolina flour 1 large egg 11g sugar 1 tablespoon Pizza Dough Flavor (optional, but delicious) 18g King Arthur Easy-Roll Dough Improver (optional, but very helpful) 2 teaspoons instant yeast 46g potato flour or potato flakes 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 50g dried buttermilk powder 2 teaspoons dry mustard powder 57g shredded Cheddar cheese 227g to 283g water 
    
     Directions   Mix and then knead together all of the ingredients — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.   Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 hour.  Divide the dough into six pieces.  Round each piece into a ball and shape each ball into a flattened round about 4" in diameter. Place each round in a lightly greased cup of a hamburger bun pan, or onto a parchment-lined sheet pan.  Cover the rolls, and allow them to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until they're puffy.  While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes, covering them lightly with aluminum foil if they look like they're browning too quickly.   Store the rolls in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days or freeze them for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  To make smaller, dinner-size rolls, divide the dough into 16 pieces, and round each piece into a ball. Place the rolls in a lightly greased pan, such as 14" x 2" round multi-purpose bread pan or 12" x 12" sticky bun pan, let them rise for an hour, and bake in a preheated 350°F oven for 15 to 18 minutes, or until they're golden brown.

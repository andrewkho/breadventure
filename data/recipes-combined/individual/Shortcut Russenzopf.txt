Shortcut Russenzopf
    
    Traditionally made with labor-intensive laminated croissant dough and hazelnut filling, we've made this treat easier for the home baker — and every bit as delicious! 
    
     Dough  Use your favorite  brioche  or other sweet bread recipe; the recipe should use about 3 cups of flour. Prepare the dough up through its first rise.  Filling  96g pecan meal, or hazelnut or almond flour, toasted or plain 74g sugar 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt 2 large egg whites 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8" round cake pan.  Stir together the filling ingredients.  Gently deflate the dough, and roll it into an 11" x 16" rectangle. Spread the filling over the dough, leaving a 1" margin along the short edge closest to you.  Starting with the filled edge, roll the dough into a log, pinching the seam closed. Gently roll the log until it's about 14" long.   Use a sharp knife to cut the log in half lengthwise. Twist the two halves together, trying to keep the cut sides facing up as much as possible.  Form the twisted log into a ring and place it in the prepared pan. Cover the russenzopf with a damp cloth or lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise for 45 minutes. It won't double in bulk, but will look a bit puffy.  Bake the russenzopf for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the bread feels firm on top and the internal temperature reaches 190°F. The bread will brown quite a bit due to the nuts — tent it lightly with a sheet of foil halfway through the baking time.   Remove the bread from the oven, and after 10 minutes gently remove it from the pan and allow it to cool on a rack.  Store, covered, for 3 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

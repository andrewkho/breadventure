    Ideal for chili, a thick, hearty soup or stew, these bread bowls are more than recyclable — they're delicious! 
    
       361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 163g semolina 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 7g non-diastatic malt OR 2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 340g water 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Divide the dough into five pieces, and form them into round (not flattened) balls.   Place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, cover lightly, and set them aside to rise in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours, or until they've almost doubled in size.  Uncover the balls and let them sit for 10 to 15 minutes, to develop a tough skin.  While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 425°F.  Just before placing the bread bowls in the oven, mist them heavily with water.  Bake the bread bowls  for 18 to 22 minutes, until they're a deep, golden brown. Turn off the oven, prop the door open a little, and leave the bread bowls inside for 15 minutes; this will keep the crust crisp.  Remove the bread bowls from the oven and cool them completely before cutting the tops off and removing the insides.  Store for 3 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  You can reserve the insides to make bread crumbs.

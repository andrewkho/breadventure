Irish Soda Bread, American Style
    
    Sweeter and more tender than traditional Irish soda bread, this "Americanized" version is sure to please any aficionado of the genre.
    
       539g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 21g baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 227g butter 2 large eggs 198g sugar 454g milk 7g caraway seeds 227g raisins 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly grease a deep cake pan, tube pan, angel-food or springform pan; the pan should be at least 2 3/4" deep.  In a large bowl, sift together the dry ingredients; set aside.  In another bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until smooth; then add the eggs, beating until smooth and creamy.  Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients alternately with the milk.  Stir in the caraway seeds and raisins.  Spoon the batter into the pan.  Bake the bread  for about 1 hour, 40 minutes (less in a tube or angel-food pan), or until a cake tester inserted about 1" deep into the center-top of the loaf comes out clean. If you're using a digital thermometer, the temperature should be between 195°F-200°F.   Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack before slicing.  Store, well-wrapped, for 3 days on the counter, or freeze for up to 3 months.

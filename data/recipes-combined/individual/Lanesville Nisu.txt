Lanesville Nisu
    
    Nisu, or pulla, is the name of a Finnish yeasted coffee cake. Traditionally served with coffee, some Finns put sugar cubes in their mouths, take a bite of the bread and swallow a bit of coffee. The bread itself is very tender, with a sugary glaze, and lends itself well to toasting, or pillowy French toast.  Use your bread machine to make the dough, then shape and bake the loaf yourself.
    
     Dough  227g warm water 1 large egg 28g butter 39g sugar 447g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 3 cardamom seeds, crushed, or 1 teaspoon ground cardamom 2 teaspoons instant yeast  Glaze  1 large egg, beaten 14g milk 11g sugar 
    
     Directions   Put all of the dough ingredients into the pan of your bread machine and program for Dough or Manual. Check the dough after a few minutes of kneading, adding flour or water to achieve a smooth, soft consistency.  When the dough cycle is complete, remove the dough from the pan and roll it into a 1/2" thick rectangle. Cut it lengthwise into three equal strips.  Braid the strips into a loaf, tucking the ends under.  Let the loaf rise, covered, on a parchment-lined baking sheet for about 1 hour, or until it's doubled in size.  Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.  Bake the bread for about 30 minutes, or until it's golden brown.  Remove it from the oven and brush it with the glaze, which you've made by whisking together the egg, milk and sugar.  Place the bread back in the oven for 1 minute, then remove it and cool it on a rack.   Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

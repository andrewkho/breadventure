Gluten-Free Millet Bread
    
    You can finally savor the flavor of gluten-free bread with this curiously crunchy millet-studded whole-grain loaf.
    
       103g millet, soaked 181g Gluten-Free Whole Grain Flour Blend 57g potato starch 50g almond flour 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum 3/4 teaspoon salt 57g soft butter 3 large eggs 43g honey 170g warm milk 
    
     Directions   Cover the millet with warm water and soak it at room temperature overnight, or for a least a few hours. Drain any remaining water from the millet before using.  Combine all the dry ingredients in the bowl of your stand mixer and blend thoroughly.  Add the butter and blend until the mixture is like sandy crumbs.  Add the eggs, honey and warm milk, beating well for 2 to 3 minutes, stopping once to scrape the sides of the bowl.   Stir in the drained millet.  Cover the dough and allow it to rise at room temperature for about 1 hour.  Preheat your oven to 350°F and lightly grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan.  Scrape the dough (which will be the consistency of a thick batter) into the prepared pan and allow it to rise again, covered, for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until it's risen just above the rim of the pan.  Bake the bread for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the internal temperature reaches 205°F to 210°F. The top should be a lovely golden brown. If the loaf begins to brown too much before it's finished baking, tent it with aluminum foil for the remainder of the bake. Cool completely before cutting and serving.

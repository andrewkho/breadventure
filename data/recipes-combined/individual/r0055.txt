the bowl. turn out and knead for 10 minutes. place the dough in a
lightly greased bowl and cover with a clean tea towel and let rise
about 1 1/2 hours. punch dough down and let rise again for 30 to 45
minutes. punch down and let rest for 10 minutes. turn the dough onto
a floured board and roll into a 15" x 10" oblong.  roll up tightly
toward you, beginning with the wide side. with a hand on each end,
roll the loaf back and forth to taper the ends and lengthen the loaf.
place diagonally on a greased and cornmeal- sprinkled cookie sheet.
slash at 2" intervals and let rise uncovered for about 1 1/2 hours.
place in a 425 f oven.  for the first 15 minutes, spray with a fine
mist of water every four minutes. reduce heat to 350 f and bake 20
minutes longer.  the loaf should be golden brown and slide off the
sheet easily.

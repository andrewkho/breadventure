Golden Buttermilk Loaf
    
    This soft, tender loaf is great for sandwiches and toast.
    
     Dough  340g Pastry Flour Blend (See "tips", below.) 82g semolina flour (See "tips", below.) 11g buttermilk powder 25g sugar 1/2 teaspoon Buttery Sweet Dough Flavor, optional 8g instant yeast 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 43g butter 255g water  Topping (optional)  1 large egg white  sesame seeds 14g water 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix, then knead — by hand, mixer or bread machine — to form a smooth, soft dough, adding additional water or flour as necessary, about 8 minutes.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, until almost doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.  Turn the dough out onto a greased surface, gently deflate it, and shape it into an 8 1/2" log.  Place the log in a lightly greased 9" x 5" pan, cover the pan, and allow the loaf to rise for 45 minutes, until it's just crowned over the top of the pan.  To make the topping: Whisk egg white with water.  Brush the top of the loaf with lightly beaten egg white, and sprinkle with sesame seeds.   Bake the bread in a preheated 350°F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, until it's golden brown and its internal temperature registers 190°F or above on an instant-read thermometer.  Remove it from the oven, cool it in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out of the pan and cool completely for easiest slicing.  Store, wrapped, at room temperature for 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Use all King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour, if you choose, increasing the water to about 1 1/4 cups.

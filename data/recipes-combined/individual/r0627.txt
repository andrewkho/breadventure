corn muffins (samuel)

breads, vegetarian

2 cup corn flour or cornmeal  (yellow or; blue)
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
6 oz soft tofu
3 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt (sea salt in book)

mix flours. crumble tofu into blender.  add boiled water and salt to
tofu in blender (carefully) and blend until not quite smooth. (just a
few pulses please). dont do this in too small blender or without lid
like i did once. the goal is muffins, not 2nd degree burns. add
immediately to flour and mix well. spoon into muffin tins or cast
iron stick trays and bake at 400 degrees for about 1/2 hour until
golden brown. she suggests you heat oven first and place oiled muffin
tins in to heat up beforehand to get a "wonderful crust".

please note, i have to oil the tins because i don't use teflon
products around by birds, but this might work also.....this is not
sweet bread, i serve corn potato chowder with it. the corn sticks are
better!

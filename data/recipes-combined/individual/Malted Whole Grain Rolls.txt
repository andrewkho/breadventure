Malted Whole Grain Rolls
    
    With their touch of sweetness and soft, moist crumb, these rolls are a versatile addition to your bread-baking repertoire. Bring them along on a summer picnic to serve with a selection of salads or cold cuts; or serve them with butter and jam for a simple breakfast treat.
    
       340g lukewarm water 177g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 170g King Arthur Premium Whole Wheat Flour 46g potato flour or soy flour 96g malted wheat flakes 1 tablespoon whole grain bread improver, optional, for best rise 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 35g malted milk powder or 2 tablespoons brown sugar 25g vegetable oil 2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Combine all the ingredients, and mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a smooth, slightly sticky dough.   Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy.   Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly floured work surface.  Divide the dough into seven equal pieces, and roll each piece into a smooth ball.   Place the rolls in a buttered terracotta tear and share pan (or 9" round pan), cover, and let rise until they're quite puffy, about 45 to 50 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 375°F.   Bake the rolls for 28 to 32 minutes, until they're golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of one reads at least 190°F.   Remove the rolls from the oven, brush with melted butter, if desired, and cool for 5 to 10 minutes in the pan before transferring to a rack to cool completely.   Yield: 7 rolls.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  These rolls can also be baked on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Space them about 2" apart for crustier rolls, or just 1" apart for soft-sided rolls.

Semolina Rolls
    
    Semolina, a slightly coarser grind of durum wheat, lends a pale yellow hue and nutty overtones to these rolls. While subtle in flavor when unseasoned, adding cheese and spices makes these rolls the star at your burger cookout.
    
       2 teaspoons sugar 2 teaspoons instant yeast 283g to 312g warm water, 105-110°F 326g semolina 85g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 25g dry buttermilk powder 11g olive oil 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 57g grated cheddar cheese, optional 3/4 teaspoon chili powder, optional 1/8 teaspoon cumin powder, optional 82g semolina, for coating the rolls before baking 
    
     Directions   Combine all the dough ingredients from the sugar to the salt and mix and knead — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a smooth, supple dough, adding more water or flour as needed. Add the cheese and spices during the last 5 minutes of kneading. (See "tips", below.)  After the dough is kneaded, set it aside to rise, covered, for an hour, or until it's puffy.  Grease (or line with parchment) a baking sheet for the rolls.  Punch down the dough, knead it briefly and shape it into a log; divide it into 12 equal pieces.  Form each piece into a smooth, round ball, roll the top surface of each ball in the semolina to coat and place, evenly spaced, on the prepared baking sheet.  Cover the rolls and let them rise until doubled in size, about 30 minutes.  Preheat your oven to 400°F.  Spritz the rolls lightly with water. Bake them for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.  Store, well-wrapped, for 3 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  If you're adding the cheese to the dough, the dough should be slightly stiffer than plain roll dough.Practice helps when making buns, but so does a video refresher showing you how to shape rolls.

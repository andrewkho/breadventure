Harvest Buns
    
    Whole grains, seeds and currants make these delightful "knots" both nutty and slightly sweet.
    
       298g warm water 28g brown sugar 39g vegetable oil 28g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 25g Easy-Roll Dough Improver 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 99g Harvest Grains Blend 390g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast 71g currants 2 tablespoons butter, melted, for brushing on the buns 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients except the currants and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough. Knead in the currants at the end.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for about 1 hour, or until it's doubled in bulk.  Divide the dough into 16 pieces.  Roll each piece into an 8" rope. Tie a knot in each rope, tucking the loose ends underneath.  Put the buns on a lightly greased baking sheet and let them rise, covered, for 1 hour, or until they're puffy.  Preheat the oven to 375°F after about 45 minutes.  Bake the buns in the preheated oven for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they're a light golden brown.   Remove them from the oven, and brush them with butter, if desired. This will give them a soft crust.  Store the leftover buns, wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to a month.

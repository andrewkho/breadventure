corn bread from scratch 2 to 3 hours

corn bread mix is so successful you really don't need to make it from
scratch, but it costs more than a hand-mixed version. i grease the
mold for corn bread with bacon drippings.

to cook: in a medium bowl, sift together the flour, cornmeal, sugar,
baking powder, and salt. make a well in the center. turn the egg,
milk, and melted butter or oil into the well and beat into the dry
mixture until just moistened. turn into a greased 2-quart mold, cover
with a plate, and place on a trivet or rack in the bottom of the slow
cooker. cover the cooker, cook on high for 2 to 3 hours. makes 6
servings.

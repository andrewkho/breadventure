Our Best-Ever Oatmeal Bread
    
    OK, we all agree: this is our #1 recipe for oatmeal bread. Sweeter than most, it's nutty, moist and tender, perfect for both toast AND peanut butter sandwiches.
    
       283g boiling water 50g rolled oats 28g butter 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 39g molasses or maple syrup 43g honey 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk 361g to 390g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 57g pecan meal, almond flour or finely diced pecans, almonds or walnuts 
    
     Directions   Place the boiling water, oats, butter, salt, molasses or syrup, and honey into a medium-sized bowl, stir, and let the mixture cool to lukewarm.  Mix the remaining dough ingredients (using the lesser amount of flour) with the oat mixture, and knead — by hand, mixer, bread machine or food processor — until you've made a soft, smooth dough. Add the extra flour (if necessary) while you're kneading.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise for 1 hour; the dough should be puffy.  Gently deflate dough, shape it into a log, and place it in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Cover the pan with lightly greased plastic wrap or a proof cover, and let the loaf rise about 45 minutes, or until it's crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.   Bake the bread for 40 to 45 minutes, tenting it loosely with aluminum foil if it seems to be browning too quickly.  Remove it from the oven when the internal temperature registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer. After 5 minutes, remove the loaf from the pan and allow it to cool on a wire rack.  Store, covered, for 5 days at room temperature. Freeze for up to 3 months.

1 cup sugar

2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup walnuts, chopped
1  rum, vanilla, or amaretto (optional; )

the bananas.  mix in the remaining ingredients.  pour into a greased loaf
pan. bake 1 hour 15-20 minutes at 350 degrees f.

notes:

*  this recipe is from my friend ayalla -- it makes a heavy, but moist,
loaf of banana bread.

*  if you use more than 3 normal-size bananas, i suggest that you lower the
oven temperature and cook for a while longer.  otherwise, the crust comes
out almost overcooked while the middle remains moist and almost
undercooked.

: difficulty:  easy.
: time:  preparation:  10 minutes; baking:  at least 95 minutes. allow some
time for cooling.
: precision:  approximate measurement ok.

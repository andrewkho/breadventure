     Directions   To make the dough in a bread machine: Put all of the ingredients into the bucket of your bread machine. Program for dough or manual, and start the machine.  Check the dough after about 15 minutes; it should be smooth-looking. If not, adjust the consistency with additional flour or water. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.  To make the dough by hand: Combine all of the ingredients and mix and knead until cohesive and smooth. Allow the dough to rise in a covered bowl for 1 hour.   Shape the dough into a log, and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan. Set the loaf aside to rise, covered, for about 45 minutes, or until it's crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan.  While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for about 35 minutes, or until it's golden brown and the interior of the loaf registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove it from the oven, and cool on a wire rack.  Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

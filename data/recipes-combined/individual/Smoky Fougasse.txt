Smoky Fougasse
    
    Fougasse, a specialty of Provence, France, is made from a simple bread dough and often embellished with cheeses, herbs, nuts or anchovies. The dough is shaped in a flat oval or circle, which is then slashed several times through, and the openings are gently pulled to create ladder- or leaf-like openings. This pull-apart bread features lots of chewy crust, and the heady flavors of onion and smoked cheese.
    
     Starter  120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or First Clear Flour 227g water 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast  Dough  241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons Pizza Dough Flavor (optional) 1 teaspoon instant yeast 1 teaspoon salt 25g olive oil 113g diced smoked Gruyere, Havarti, or Gouda cheese 39g golden baking onions or french-fried onions 
    
     Directions   Mix the sponge ingredients together, and let the mixture rest, covered, for 4 and up to 24 hours.  Mix together the sponge and the remaining dough ingredients, except for the cheese and onions, and mix, then knead — by hand, mixer or bread machine — to form a smooth, soft dough, adding additional water or flour as necessary, about 8 minutes. Knead in the cheese and onions.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, until it's puffy looking, about 1 1/2 hours.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased or floured work surface. Shape it into a round or oval, pulling and stretching until it's no more than 3/4" thick.  Place it on a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet. Brush it lightly with olive oil, then cut decorative slits into it, all the way through the bottom.  Pull the dough apart widely (at least 2" apart) at the slits, to make a nice shape. Cover it, and let it rise for 30 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 450°F.  Bake the fougasse for 16 to 18 minutes, until it's a deep, golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and cool it on a rack.  Store, well-wrapped, for 2 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to a month.

     Dough  57g butter 227g milk 482g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast 67g sugar 1 teaspoon salt 2 large eggs plus 1 yolk (save the white for glaze) 1 1/2 teaspoons Buttery Sweet Dough Flavor or 1/8 teaspoon coconut flavor or 1/4 teaspoon orange oil or Fiori di Sicilia 1 cup (5 ounces) King Arthur Flour Tropical Fruit Blend, or a mixture of your favorite dried fruits  Topping  50g sugar 39g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 28g butter 
    
     Directions   Melt the butter with the milk and let the mixture cool to lukewarm.  Combine the milk mixture with the remaining dough ingredients, except the fruit, and mix and knead to make a soft dough.   Knead in the fruit.   Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 1/2 hours, or until it becomes puffy and nearly doubles in size.  Deflate the dough. Divide it into six pieces, shaping each into a ball; or divide dough in half, shaping each half into an 8" log.   Place in six lightly greased 1 3/4-cup rectangular bakers, or two 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pans.   Let rise, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, till crowned about 1" over the rims of the pans. Just before the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350Â°F.  Beat the reserved egg white, and brush over the tops of the loaves.  Mix the topping ingredients until crumbly, and sprinkle on top.   Bake the bread for 25 to 30 minutes, until lightly browned.   Remove from the oven, turn out of the pans, and cool completely on a rack.   For prettiest presentation, return small loaves to their pans just before serving.  Yield: 6 small loaves or two full-size loaves.

       418g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 113g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 35g Bakers' Special Dry Milk 37g artisan bread topping 28g toasted sesame seeds 11g vegetable oil or 14g butter 340g water 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for about 1 1/4 hours, or until it's puffy (though not necessarily doubled in bulk).   Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Place the dough on a lightly greased work surface, and knead it gently to expel some of the gas.  Shape it into a 9" log, and place it in the pan. Cover the pan, and allow the bread to rise for about 1 hour, or until it's crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 40 to 50 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 190°F. If the bread appears to be browning too quickly, tent it lightly with aluminum foil.   Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out of the pan to cool completely on a wire rack.  Store the loaves, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  If the bread appears to be browning too quickly, tent it lightly with aluminum foil. This bread can also be baked in a 1 1/2-pound or larger bread machine. Program the machine for basic or white bread, medium crust.

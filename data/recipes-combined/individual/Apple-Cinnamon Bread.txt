Apple-Cinnamon Bread
    
    This bread makes the most wonderful toast. It's also very nice spread with cream cheese.
    
     Dough  361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 57g apple nuggets or chopped dried apples 28g King Arthur Easy-Roll Dough Improver (optional, but very helpful) 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 11g instant yeast 43g butter 18g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 227g water  Filling  113g Baker's Cinnamon Filling (See "tips," below.) 43g water 
    
     Directions   In a mini food processor or blender, combine 1/2 cup of the flour and all of the apple nuggets. Process until apples are coarsely chopped.   Combine the apple-flour mixture with the remaining dough ingredients, and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 hour.  Roll the dough into an 8" x 24" rectangle.  Mix together the filling ingredients, and spread it on the dough, leaving a 1" border.  Roll the dough up starting with a short edge, pinch the ends closed, and fit it, seam-side down, into a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan.  Cover the pan, and allow the loaf to rise for about 1 hour, or until it's crowned a scant 1" above the pan's rim.  Bake the bread in a preheated 350°F oven for 40 to 45 minutes, tenting it lightly with aluminum foil after 20 minutes so that it doesn't over-brown.   Remove bread from the oven, and allow it to cool on a wire rack.  Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature.  Freeze for up to 3 months.

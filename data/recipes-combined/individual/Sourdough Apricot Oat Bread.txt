       142g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 85g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 50g old-fashioned rolled oats, plus more for sprinkling 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 113g unsalted butter 198g sugar 2 large eggs 1 tablespoon grated orange rind (zest) 113g orange juice 227g sourdough starter, unfed/discard  128g diced dried apricots 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven too 350Â°F. Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  In a large bowl, whisk together the flours, oats, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  In a separate bowl, beat together the butter and sugar until fluffy. Add the eggs one at a time, beating until the first egg is absorbed before adding the next. Scrape the sides and bottom of the bowl.  Add the orange zest, then one third of the dry ingredients. Mix well. Add the orange juice, then another third of the dry ingredients. Mix for 30 seconds, then add the starter and the remaining dry ingredients. Mix to combine, then stir in the apricots.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and sprinkle the top with oats.  Bake the bread until a paring knife inserted in the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and place on a rack. Cool in the pan for 15 to 20 minutes before turning out of the pan and returning to the rack. Cool completely before slicing.  Store the bread, tightly wrapped in plastic, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.   
    
     Tips from our bakers  Recipe update: To address issues of crumbly, dry texture, we've reduced the amount of white whole wheat flour from 1 1/2 cups to 1 1/4 cups; and the amount of baking powder from 2 teaspoons to 1 teaspoon. The resulting moist loaf holds together well and slices nicely.

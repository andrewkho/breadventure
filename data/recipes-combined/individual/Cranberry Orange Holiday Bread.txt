     Directions   For the dough: Mix and knead all of the dough ingredients together to make a soft, smooth dough. Let the dough rise for 1 1/2 hours, until it's almost double in bulk.  Filling 1: Mix the butter, sugar, and vanilla. Set aside.   Filling 2: Soak the dried cranberries or fruitcake blend in the water or brandy.  To assemble: Roll the dough into a 14" x 30" rectangle. Spread with Filling 1, then sprinkle with the soaked fruit, cherries, almonds, and flour. Roll into a log, starting with a long end.  Grease a 10" ring pan, or a baking sheet.   Slice the log horizontally. Gently twist one piece around the other, keeping the layers facing upward.   Fit the dough into the ring mold or shape into a circle on the baking sheet. Pinch the ends together.   Cover and let rise till puffy, about 45 minutes.   Bake in a preheated 350Â°F oven for 30 to 35 minutes, until lightly browned at the edges. Remove from the oven and cool for 30 minutes or longer before glazing.  To make the glaze: Combine the butter and milk. Mix in the orange flavor and sugar until smooth. Drizzle over cooled loaf.  Yield: one large circular loaf, 16 servings.

1 tablespoon salt
1 pkg dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon honey
2 cup bread flour

1/4 cup bread flour
1  filling:
1/2 cup thousand island dressing
16 oz sauerkraut, drained
1/2 lb corned beef, thinly sliced
1/2 lb swiss cheese, thinly sliced

in medium saucepan, combine corn meal and beer.  heat to boiling and

stir in yeast, sugar and honey and let stand for 5 minutes. pour
mixture into large mixing bowl and add 2 cups of bread flour,
stirring until well blended. add rye flour and caraway seeds and mix
thoroughly. place dough on a lightly floured board and work in enough
of remaining 1/4 cup bread flour to reduce stickiness and make dough
workable. place dough in oiled bowl and turn to coat all sides. let
rise until doubled in bulk.

punch dough down and let rest for 10 minutes.  divide dough in half,
covering one piece.  on a floured surface, roll other piece into
rectangle not longer than baking sheet. trim dough so that rectangle
is a true shape. lightly score dough into thirds lengthwise. spread
1/2 dressing over the center third, leaving 1 inch at top and bottom
of section uncovered. cover dressing with 1/2 sauerkraut, 1/2 corned
beef and 1/2 cheese. fold 1 inch at top and bottom over filling and
pinch to seal. on each side of filling, make cuts at 1-inch
intervals. cuts begin 1/2 inch from filling and go to outer edges.
beginning on right, pull top strip across middle and seal end on
other side of filling. pull top left strip across middle and seal;
alternate in braiding fashion until all strips are secured. repeat
with other ball of dough. cover and let rest for 30 minutes. place on
greased baking sheet and bake at 350 f for 30 minutes. slice to serve.

Deli Rye Blitz Bread
    
    This light-as-air, high-rising no-knead bread goes together in just a couple of minutes. Surprisingly, there's no rye flour in this bread; mustard and caraway seeds give it crunch and assertive flavor, while our Deli Rye Flavor adds the perfect touch of authentic deli taste. A layer of crunchy sauerkraut on top is the perfect final touch - your ham and cheese on rye never had it so good!
    
       340g warm water 35g vegetable oil 418g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon caraway seeds 1 tablespoon mustard seeds: brown, yellow, or a combination 1 teaspoon Deli Rye Flavor 1 tablespoon instant yeast 135g drained sauerkraut*, rinsed and squeezed dry *If you're using canned sauerkraut, a 14 1/2-ounce can, drained and squeezed dry, is the right amount. 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients except the sauerkraut in a large bowl, and beat at high speed for 1 minute.  Scoop the batter into a lightly greased 9" x 13" pan. Spread the sauerkraut evenly on top.  Cover the pan, and let the dough rise for 90 minutes, or until it's noticeably puffy. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until it's starting to brown around the edges, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers at least 190°F.   Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool.  Yield: Enough bread for 6 to 8 sandwiches, or 12 bread-basket servings.

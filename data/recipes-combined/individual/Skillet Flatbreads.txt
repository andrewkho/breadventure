Skillet Flatbreads
    
    Using a basic ratio of five pantry staples, you can have fresh, hot bread on the table in less than 30 minutes AND no need to turn on the oven. Add and change ingredients to your taste, and you'll have an endless array of tasty flatbreads to accompany any meal. 
    
       361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 35g olive oil or vegetable oil 227g ice water 25g to 35g additional tablespoons vegetable oil, for frying 
    
     Directions   Place the flour, baking powder, and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir to combine.   Add the oil and ice water, and mix to make a soft, cohesive dough. Adjust with flour or water as needed. The dough should be moist but not sticky. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 10 minutes.   Preheat a heavy-bottomed skillet on the stovetop. Add 1 tablespoon oil and heat until the oil starts to shimmer in the pan.   Divide the dough into 10 to 12 equal pieces. Each piece should weigh about 1 1/2 to 2 ounces, about the size of a large egg. Dredge each piece in flour, and roll to a rough circle or oval, about 1/4" thick. OR hand shape the pieces by flattening between your palms.   In batches, fry the flatbreads in the hot oil for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Flip and fry on the second side for another 2 minutes. Transfer from the pan to a rack to cool slightly before serving. Add more oil as needed for frying successive batches.   Yield: 10 to 12 flatbreads.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Rye variation (pictured): Replace 1 cup of the all-purpose flour with 1 cup Perfect Rye Flour Blend and 2 teaspoons Deli Rye Flavor. All other ingredients remain the same. Serve with cream cheese, chives, tomato, thinly sliced onion and capers.  Pizza bread version: Add 2 teaspoons Pizza Dough Flavor and 2 teaspoons dried Italian herbs or Pizza Seasoning to the flour mixture. Serve with marinara sauce for dipping.

Stollen Muffins
    
    We love traditional stollen for the rich, fruit-studded, sugar-coated bread that it is. Sometimes, though, we want the flavor without the wait — which is just what these muffins provide. They're quick and easy to stir together, and thanks to our stollen spice blend, they mimic that distinct flavor we long for around the holidays. 
    
     Muffins  269g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 14g Yuletide Cheer Spice; or 2 teaspoons orange zest, 1 teaspoon cardamom, 3/4 teaspoon coriander, 1/2 teaspoon mace, 1/4 teaspoon allspice, and 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 67g granulated sugar 156g Fruitcake Fruit Blend (or fruit blend of your choice) 85g candied mixed peel 1 large egg 227g buttermilk or plain (not Greek-style) unflavored yogurt 85g melted butter  Topping  28g melted butter non-melting white sugar, or confectioners' or glazing sugar 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 400°F. Lightly grease a standard muffin pan; or line it with papers, and grease the papers.  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, stollen spice, sugar, and the fruits and candied peel.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg, buttermilk or yogurt, and melted butter.  Quickly and gently combine the dry and wet ingredients; this should only take a few stirs with a bowl scraper or large spoon. The batter will be stiff.  Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, filling the cups about 3/4 full.   Bake the muffins for 20 minutes, until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center of one muffin comes out clean.  Remove the pan from the oven, wait 5 minutes, then transfer the muffins to a rack.   Brush the tops of the muffins with the melted butter, then dust with sugar.   Serve warm or at room temperature.  Yield: 12 muffins.

cinnamon twist (basic sweet dough)

breads

1/2  recipe basic sweet dough
1 1/2 tablespoon lightly salted butter or margarine,; melted
1/4 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/3 cup dark seedless raisins
1/4 cup chopped walnuts
1/2 cup confectioner's sugar
1 tablespoon warm milk
1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract

prepare the basic sweet dough.  lightly grease a baking sheet.

on a lightly floured surface, roll out the basic sweet dough to a
rectangle 14 x 10-inches.  brush with the melted butter.

mix the sugar and cinnamon; sprinkle over the dough. sprinkle with the
raisins and walnuts.  roll up the dough, jelly-roll style, starting
from one long side. pinch the ends and seam to seal and place the
roll, seam down, on the center of the baking sheet.

with scissors, cut the roll at 1-inch intervals almost through to the
bottom of the roll.  pull the first slice to the right side and the
next slice to the left side. continue, alternating to the right and
left. tuck in any raisins that fall out.  cover and let rise in a
warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.

heat the oven to 350f.  bake the coffeecake for 25 to 30 minutes, or
until lightly browned.  remove from the baking sheet and cool on a
wire rack. while the coffeecake is still warm, mix the confectioners'
sugar with the milk and vanilla; spread over the cake.

makes one large coffeecake.

note:

for a less sweet coffeecake, omit the confectioners' sugar. instead,
mix 2 teaspoons of milk with 1 teaspoon of granulated sugar and brush
over the bread as soon as it comes out of the oven.

Oatmeal and Applesauce Bread
    
    Quick breads cover a wide range, from biscuits and scones, which are made from a dough, to muffins and loaves that are made from a batter. They can be large or small, savory or sweet. The major thing that identifies them is the fact that they are, as their name implies, quick to make.
    
       298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 2 teaspoons baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon cinnamon 149g rolled oats 159g light brown sugar 50g vegetable oil 3 large egg whites, slightly beaten 510g unsweetened applesauce 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease two standard 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pans and set aside.   Use a whisk to stir together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon.  Mix in the oats and set aside.  Beat the brown sugar and the oil together, then add the egg whites and the applesauce.  Stir in the dry ingredients and mix until combined.  Spoon the batter into the two prepared pans.  Bake for 50 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean. Cool on a wire rack.  Store at room temperature for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

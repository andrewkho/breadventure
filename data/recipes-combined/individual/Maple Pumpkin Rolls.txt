Maple Pumpkin Rolls
    
    As far as trendy, autumnal flavor combinations go, pumpkin and maple is fast becoming one of our favorites. Here we've taken a popular breakfast treat, the classic cinnamon roll, and dressed it up for even the hippest breakfast table.

     Directions   To make the dough: Mix and knead all of the ingredients together to make a soft, fairly smooth dough. Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise for 1 1/2 hours, until almost doubled in bulk.  To make the filling: Beat together all of the ingredients until smooth and creamy.  To assemble the rolls: Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface, and roll or pat it into a 14" x 22" rectangle.   Spread an even layer of filling onto the dough; sprinkle with pecans, if desired.  Starting with a  long end, roll the dough into a log, jelly-roll style. Seal the edge of the log by pinching the dough together.   Cut the log into twelve  1 1/2"-thick rolls and place them into a lightly greased 10" x 10" pan or 9" x 13" pan. Cover the pan and let the rolls rise for 1 hour, until puffy.  Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.  Bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes, until they're lightly browned and feel set. Remove them from the oven, and transfer them to a rack to cool slightly.  To make the glaze: Stir together all the ingredients, adding enough maple syrup to make a spreadable glaze. Spread onto the warm rolls.    Serve the rolls warm or at room temperature. Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Don't have maple sugar for the filling? Substitute brown sugar; the rolls will have milder maple flavor, but will still be delicious.

1/2 cup icing sugar
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/4 cup corn syrup (dark is best)
1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin
2/3 cup sweetened condensed milk

an upside down toffee-like confection.

first layer: measure first 3 ingredients into bowl. crumble together
well. press in ungreased 8 x 8-inch pan. bake in 350 f oven for 20 to
25 minutes. cool.

second layer: melt the scond amount of butter and corn syrup in heavy
saucepan. measure sugar in cup. stir in gelatin to mix thoroughly.
add to saucepan stirring to dissolve. add condensed milk. stir,
bringing to a boil. boil 4 minutes stirring constantly. it burns very
easily when boiling. remove from heat. beat with spoon until it
thickens and gets blobby. you will need to take a moment's rest now
and then as you beat. pour over first layer. chill overnight. invert
on plastic wrap. this makes it much easier to cur through to the
bottom. cut into 25 squares.

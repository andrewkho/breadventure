Sourdough Pumpkin Spice Bread
    
    Adding sourdough starter to this classic fall recipe gives it a lighter texture and intriguing, tangy flavor.
    
       67g vegetable oil 99g sugar 85g molasses 2 large eggs 227g pumpkin purée 170g sourdough starter, unfed/discard 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon ground cloves 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 57g chopped walnuts 85g raisins, packed 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  In a large bowl, stir together the oil, sugar, molasses, eggs, and pumpkin. Stir in the starter and vanilla.   In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, spices, baking powder, and baking soda. Stir the dry ingredients into the wet until evenly combined. Stir in the nuts and raisins.  Transfer the batter to the prepared pan and bake for 60 to 65 minutes, until a paring knife inserted in the center comes out clean.   Remove the bread from the oven and cool it in the pan on a rack for 15 minutes before turning it out of the pan back onto the rack. Allow the bread to finish cooling completely before slicing.   Store the bread, tightly wrapped in plastic, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.

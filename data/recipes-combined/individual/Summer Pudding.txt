Summer Pudding
    
    Summer pudding was devised by the English in the 19th century for people who wanted something that tasted richer than it actually was. This pudding, also designed to use up stale bread, is chilled rather than baked. Use whatever berries are in season; in this version, we use a combination of strawberries and blueberries, which gives the pudding a deep purple hue.
    
       8 half-inch thick slices semolina bread or other mild-flavored bread, crusts removed 907g fresh or frozen berries 198g sugar 
    
     Directions   Butter a 1 1/2 quart bowl, then line it with plastic wrap. Line the bottom and sides of the bowl with the bread, cutting it to fit as needed.  Leave berries whole or, in the case of large strawberries, cut them in pieces. Heat the berries with the sugar over low heat until the sugar is dissolved and the juice of the berries starts to flow. (If you're using sweetened frozen berries, you can skip this part. Just make sure they're thoroughly thawed before you use them.)  Pour the fruit mixture over the bread. Place another layer of bread on top of the fruit, making a "lid" with these slices.  Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top of the bread "lid." Place a small plate, one which will just fit inside the bowl rim, on top of the plastic wrap. Weigh it down with something heavy (a can of beans, a jar filled with water) to force the juices up into the top layer of bread.  Refrigerate the pudding for 6 to 8 hours. The juices will seep into the bread, turning it a lovely color, and the fruit will set somewhat.  To serve, remove the weighted plate and plastic wrap. Put a serving plate upside down on top of the bowl and flip the whole thing over. Remove the plastic wrap.  Cut in wedges and top with whipped cream or yogurt sweetened with a bit of maple syrup or brown sugar.

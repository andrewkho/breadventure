bob's buffet biscuits

biscuits

40 oz biscuit mix (e.g. 1 box of bisquick; )
3/4 cup parmesan cheese, grated
1/3 cup green onions, chopped
2  eggs, slightly beaten
2 cup milk

preheat oven to 350 degrees f.  in a big bowl mix the biscuit mix, onions,
eggs, milk and about 1/2 cup of the cheese.

put the dough into a  9x13 inch baking pan and smooth it down.  you will
have to flour your hand or spatula to do this. sprinkle the rest of the
cheese over the top and then use the spatula or knife to score the dough
into square biscuits. cut all the way to the pan.

bake in a preheated oven at 350 degrees f. for 40 to 45 minutes. when they
are done a wooden toothpick stuck into the dough will come out clean.

notes:

*  some not-so-plain biscuits -- this recipe is from bob clover of
sausalito, california and was first published in _sunset_ magazine. yield:
24-30 biscuits.

*  when you take them out of the oven, flip the pan upside down over a rack
to get the biscuits out, then flip the rack over to get everything back
right side up again.

*  this is good if you are having a lot of company or want a lot of
leftovers.

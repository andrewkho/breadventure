corn tortillas (aha)

breads, mexican, heartright

1 1/2 cup water
1 1/2 tablespoon acceptable margarine
1 cup stone-ground cornmeal
1 1/2 tablespoon acceptable margarine
1 1/4 cup whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon salt

bring water to a boil in a small saucepan.  add 1 1/2 t margarine.
stir in cornmeal quickly, then immediately lower heat and cover pan.
let cornmeal cook over very low heat for 5 minutes.  stir in
remaining margarine and set aside to cool.

mix flour and salt.  stir in cooled cornmeal and knead, adding water
or more flour if necessary to form a soft dough.  pinch off twelve
pices and roll into 2-inch balls.

flatten each ball between palms or against a board, making a flat
circle. roll with rolling pin to 6-7 inches.  keep turning the circle
to keep it round, and sprinkle board and pin with cornmeal as needed
to prevent sticking.

cook on a hot ungreased griddle for 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or
until flecked with dark spots.

line a basket or bowl with a large cloth.  stack tortillas in bowl
and keep covered with cloth.

they may be made up to a day in advance.  heating for a few seconds
on each side makes them soft and pliable for handling again.  heat
them on a griddle or directly over a medium gas flame.

       340g lukewarm water 170g King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour 177g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 78g Harvest Grains Blend 21g whole flax meal 43g potato flour or potato flakes 28g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 28g soft butter or 7/8 ounce vegetable oil 2 teaspoons instant yeast  2 teaspoons poultry seasoning OR 1 1/2 teaspoons ground sage + 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients and mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a smooth dough.   Cover the dough, and allow it to rise for 1 hour, until it becomes puffy.  Shape the dough into a log, and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.   Set the loaf aside to rise, covered, for about 45 minutes, or until it?s crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan.  Bake the bread in a preheated 350°F oven for about 35 minutes, or until it's golden brown and the interior of the loaf registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer.   Remove it from the oven, and cool for 5 minutes before turning the loaf out of the pan onto a rack to cool completely.  Yield: 1 loaf.

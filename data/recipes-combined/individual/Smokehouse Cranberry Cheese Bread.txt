Smokehouse Cranberry Cheese Bread
    
    This delightful bread was the 2015 National Festival of Breads Champion. Lisa Keys, from Pennsylvania, was inspired to create this bread from her visits to Vermont. She spent her days eating smoked cheeses and fresh maple syrup from local farmers. This flavor-packed bread honors all of her fondest Vermont memories. 
    
       227g unsalted butter, softened 113g silken tofu 4 large eggs 43g lukewarm water 28g maple syrup 227g shredded smoked Gouda or smoked Cheddar cheese 7g Red Star Platinum Yeast 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 539 to 624g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 142g sweetened dried cranberries 
    
     Directions   Beat together the butter and tofu until the mixture is light and fluffy, about 2 minutes. Scrape the sides of the bowl as needed.   Beat in the eggs one at a time, then mix in the water and maple syrup.   Stir in the cheese, yeast, salt, pepper, and 4 cups of the flour; blend well.    Mix in the cranberries and gradually add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough. Knead the dough until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes on low to medium speed of a stand mixer.   Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.   Deflate the dough and divide it in half. Shape into 6" to 7" round loaves, and place into two greased 9" round cake pans. Cover; let the loaves rise until doubled, 40 to 45 minutes. Near the end of the rise, preheat the oven to 400°F.   Uncover the fully risen dough, and with a sharp knife or lame, make a 1/4" deep "X" slash across the top of each loaf.   Bake the loaves for 25 to 27 minutes, until golden brown, tenting with aluminum foil to prevent excess browning if necessary. A digital thermometer inserted into the middle of a loaf should register about 200°F.   Remove the loaves from the oven, and after a few minutes turn them out onto a rack to cool fully.   Yield: 2 loaves, 22 servings each.

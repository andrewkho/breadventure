the "bis" means twice and "cotti" means cooked --- and our recipe for
these crisp, cruncy cookies does just that. they are best when dipped
in hot coffee, cocoa or milk for a few seconds until softened, then
eaten right away.

8    minutes; let cool.

use metal blade in food processor work bowl to finely chop zest and
granulated sugar, about 60 seconds.  add brown sugar, extracts,
margarine and eggs; process until combined, about 5 seconds. add nuts
and dry ingredients and pulse until combined, about 12 times.

transfer dough to floured surface; roll into two 12" logs. pat logs
to 2 1/2" wide.  place 3" apart on lightly greased baking sheets.
beat egg white slightly and brush over surface of logs. bake 20
minutes until firm and lightly browned.  remove from oven; reduce
heat to 325^. while still warm, cut logs diagonally into 1/2" slices,
lay cut side down on sheets. bake 15 minutes more until dry. cool on
whire racks.

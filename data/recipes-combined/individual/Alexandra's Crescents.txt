Alexandra's Crescents
    
    These soft, rich crescent rolls go perfectly with a bowl of hot soup on a cold winter's day.
    
       170g warm water 92g vegetable shortening 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon sweet dough flavor or Fiori di Sicilia or 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1 teaspoon ground coriander 113g honey 2 large eggs 2 1/4 teaspoons SAF Gold instant yeast or 1 tablespoon instant yeast 421g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 28g to 43g butter or margarine, melted Milk, for brushing the rolls 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.  Place in a lightly greased bowl and allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until it's puffy (though not necessarily doubled in bulk).   Lightly grease (or line with parchment paper) two baking sheets.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface.  Divide the dough in half. Roll each half into a large, 1/2" thick circle, and lightly brush each circle with melted butter or margarine.  Cut each circle into 16 wedges. Starting with the wide end, roll each wedge into a crescent.  Place the crescents, points tucked underneath, on the baking sheets, cover them, and allow them to rise until nearly doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.  While the crescents are rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Brush the crescents lightly with milk, and bake them for 12 to 15 minutes, or until they're lightly browned.   Remove them from the oven, and cool them on a wire rack.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 3 days, or freeze for up a month.

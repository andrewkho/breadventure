Pecan Wheat Bread (2 pound loaf)
    
    If you're lukewarm about plain whole wheat bread, try it toasted — what a difference! The naturally sweet, nutty flavor and aroma of the wheat is enhanced by the toaster's heat. Serve a few toasts at your next brunch — whole wheat, oatmeal and cinnamon — to bring out the appetite in even the pickiest breakfast eater.
    
       2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 312g water 53g dark brown sugar 28g butter 298g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 113g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 113g walnuts, chopped, or 113g pecan meal 
    
     Directions   Combine the ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until a smooth dough is formed.  Transfer it to a lightly oiled bowl, turning to coat all sides. Cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise until puffy, at least 1 hour.  Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, shape it into a log, and place it in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Tent the dough with lightly greased plastic wrap, or with a dough rising cover, and allow it to rise until it has just cleared the rim of the pan, about 45 minutes.    Preheat the oven to 350°F.   Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, tenting it with aluminum foil for the final 15 minutes. The interior temperature of the finished loaf should register 190°F on an instant-read thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven, remove it from the pan, and place it on a wire rack to cool.  Store on the counter for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  If you'd like a loaf that has a taller, mushroom shape, use an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" pan instead. Allow the bread to rise about 1" over the rim of the smaller pan.While the bread is hot, lightly brush it with butter or margarine, or spray it with butter-flavored pan spray; this will keep the crust soft and give it a nice satiny shine.

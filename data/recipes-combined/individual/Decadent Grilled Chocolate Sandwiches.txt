Decadent Grilled Chocolate Sandwiches
    
    This recipe for chocolate sandwiches — buttery, grilled chocolate sandwiches — is a runaway hit every time we make them in the test kitchen.
    
     Bread  10 slices firm-textured white bread (try our Buttertop Bread recipe)  Filling  113g heavy cream 170g bittersweet or semisweet chocolate (not unsweetened baking chocolate), broken or chopped into small pieces 28g to 43g butter 71g sparkling white sugar, optional 
    
     Directions   Bring the cream to a simmer, and stir in the chocolate; continue to stir until the mixture is shiny and smooth, heating briefly if necessary to melt the chocolate completely.  Let the chocolate cool until thickened.  Butter one side of each piece of bread.  Spread about 3 tablespoons of the chocolate onto the unbuttered side of 5 of the slices, leaving a bit around the edges uncoated.  Top with the remaining bread. Sprinkle the buttered sides of the bread with the sparkling sugar.  Grill the sandwiches over medium heat until they're golden brown on both sides. (Be careful: the sugar tends to burn if the heat is too high.) Be sure to wipe the pan between sandwiches.  Cut the sandwiches into triangles, and serve warm.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Any extra filling may be stored, refrigerated and covered for later use — it's wonderful reheated and served over ice cream.Or, if you'd rather not make the filling from scratch, just use our Chocolate Schmear filling.

corn bread ii

breads, cajun

2 cup corn meal
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon soda
2 cup buttermilk
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2  eggs, beaten

prepare large cast iron skillet:  grease generously with bacon
drippings so that bottom of skillet is well covered. place skillet in
400 f. oven to heat. meanwhile prepare batter: combine dry
ingredients, add eggs and butter milk, mixing well.  remove skillet
from oven when grease starts to smoke; scrape batter into skillet.
batter must start to sizzle as soon as it hits skillet.  place in
oven and continue baking for 20-25 minutes, or until browned on top.
i don't use this skillet for anything but corn bread and i never wash
it, just wipe out well. after a few times you will find the corn
bread will fall out of pan easily and intact. courtesy telephone

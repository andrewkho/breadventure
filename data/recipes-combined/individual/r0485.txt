for sponge, boil apricot nectar in a heavy medium saucepan over high
heat until reduced to 1 cup, about 5 minutes. pour reduced nectar
into a large bowl. cool to 120-125f. whisk in flour, sugar, milk
powder and yeast. cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise in a
warm, draft-free area until double in volume, about 30 minutes.

meanwhile, prepare dough: generously butter a 12-cup kugelhupf pan. (a
large bundt or angel food pan may be substituted.) using an electric
mixer, cream butter with sugar in a large bowl until fluffy. beat in
eggs and egg yolks 1 at a time. beat in brandy, salt, vanilla and
ginger. combine yeast and 2 tb hot water in a small bowl and stir
until yeast dissolves. mix yeast mixture and sponge into butter
mixture. gradually mix in 3 cups flour. combine chocolate, apricots,
brown sugar and cinnamon in a medium bowl. mix into dough.

spoon dough into prepared pan. cover tightly with plastic wrap and
clean kitchen towel. let stand in a warm, draft-free area until dough
rises just to the top of pan, about 3 hours.

position rack in center of oven and preheat to 350f. bake kugelhupf
until deep brown and cracking on top and tester inserted in center
comes out clean, about 48 minutes. cool on rack 20 minutes. turn out
onto rack and cool completely.

meanwhile, make chocolate swirl cream: stir chocolate and 2 tb cream
in a heavy small saucepan over low heat until chocolate melts and
mixture is smooth. cool. beat remaining 2 cups cream and sugar in a
large bowl until soft peaks form. add brandy and continue beating
until stiff peaks form. pour chocolate mixture over cream and fold
together until whipped cream is lightly streaked with chocolate.
transfer to a serving bowl and chill.

place kugelhupf on a platter. lightly sift powdered sugar over. cut
into wedges. serve with chocolate swirl cream.

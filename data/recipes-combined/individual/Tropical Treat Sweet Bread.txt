Tropical Treat Sweet Bread
    
    Milk and butter make this loaf soft and tender, while dried pineapple and coconut give it "tropical" flavor.
    
       113g lukewarm milk 2 large eggs 57g butter, soft 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 57g coconut milk powder 2 teaspoons instant yeast 25g sugar 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon coconut flavor or orange oil, or 1/8 teaspoon Fiori de Sicilia 64g dried apricots, diced 71g dried pineapple, diced 57g unsweetened coconut 57g diced nuts (macadamia, walnuts, or pecans) 
    
     Directions   Combine the milk, eggs, butter, flour, coconut milk powder, yeast, sugar, and salt. Mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, shiny dough.  Knead in the fruit and nuts, then form the dough into a ball.  Place in a greased bowl, cover, and allow the dough to rise for 1 1/2 hours, until it's puffy.   Lightly grease one-quart souffle pan, or a large brioche mold.  Turn the dough onto a greased or floured work surface, and form into a ball. Place it, smooth side up, in your pan.  Cover the loaf with a piece of greased plastic. Let the loaf rise for about 1 1/2 hours, until it's crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan.  Toward the end of the rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes, until deeply browned.  Remove it from the oven, and leave in the pan for about 10 minutes before turning it out onto a rack to cool completely.  Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Instead of a single large loaf, you can divide the dough into four pieces, place them in four mini brioche molds, and bake for about 25 to 30 minutes, until golden brown.To make an apricot-orange sweet bread, omit the coconut milk powder, pineapple, and coconut, and substitute orange oil or Fiori di Sicilia for the coconut flavor. Increase the dried apricots to 1 1/2 cups.

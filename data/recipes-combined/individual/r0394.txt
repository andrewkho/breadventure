chapatis #1

breads, indian

1/2 cup whole wheat flour
2/3 cup unbleached all purpose flour
1/2 cup water approximately
1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)

make up the dough approximately 1/2-hour before you need it. allow the
dough to rest about 10 minutes. pinch off portion of dough to form a
ball about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. roll ball flat on lightly
floured surface. pat back and forth between hands until thin.
(patting makes the chapati puff when baked.)

cook on top of the stove on ungreased griddle until browned and
puffed. use medium heat so the griddle does not get too hot.

yield: 10 servings

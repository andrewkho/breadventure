Harvest Wheat Bread
    
    Crunchy-chewy bits of cracked wheat and sunflower seeds add texture and interest to your favorite ham, turkey or veggie sandwich. One trick to a tasty grain-filled loaf? Soaking the cracked wheat in water before you combine the dough softens the grains and adds moisture to the final product.
    
       39g organic cracked wheat 283g boiling water 50g olive oil 35g sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 241g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 113g King Arthur Premium Whole Wheat Flour 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten, optional 35g sunflower seeds 2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Combine the cracked wheat and boiling water in the pan of your bread machine, and let the wheat soften for 30 minutes.  Place the remaining ingredients into the pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Program the machine for the basic cycle, and press Start.  Check the dough's consistency about 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, adding additional water or flour to form a soft, smooth ball of dough. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.  Store, wrapped, on the counter for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  To bake bread in the oven, program your machine for the dough or manual cycle. When the cycle is complete, remove the dough, and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan. Allow the dough to rise, covered, for about 1 hour, or until it's crowned about  1" over the rim of the pan. Bake the bread in a preheated 350°F oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf registers about 190°F. Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out of the pan, and let it cool on a wire rack.

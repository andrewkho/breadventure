Triple-Seed Braid
    
    This impressive-looking braid has a golden interior and seed-studded, crunchy crust. It's a beautiful addition to a fall gathering, both on display and with a meal.
    
     Dough  2 teaspoons instant yeast 326g semolina flour 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 21g potato flour 28g King Arthur Easy-Roll Dough Improver, optional 74g Harvest Grains Blend 25g oil or 28g butter 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 301g water  Topping  1 large egg + 1 tablespoon water, for glaze 25g flax seeds 25g sesame seeds 25g poppy seeds 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for about 1 1/4 hours, or until it's puffy (though not necessarily doubled in bulk).  Place the dough on a lightly greased work surface, and knead it gently to expel some of the gas.  Divide it into three equal pieces, and roll each piece into a 24" log.  Beat the egg with the water, and brush one log at a time with this egg wash.  Sprinkle each log with one type of the seeds, rolling them to coat all sides.  Let the logs "dry" for a few minutes, then braid them together.  Sprinkle with any extra seeds, and place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.  Cover and let rise for 1 hour, or until the dough springs back very slowly when lightly pressed.  While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 425°F.  Bake the bread for 15 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 350°F and continue baking for an additional 10 to 15 minutes, until the crust is golden and the bread sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.  Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it for several hours before slicing. Store well-wrapped at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for 3 months.

     Directions   Measure all of the dry ingredients into the pan of your bread machine.  Melt the butter in the water, cool to lukewarm, and add the water mixture, eggs, lemon oil and yeast to the pan.  Program your machine for light crust, whole-grain or whole wheat setting, and press Start.   Check the dough about 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle; it should be smooth and supple, not "gnarly." Adjust the consistency with additional flour or water as needed.   Allow the machine to complete its cycle, and transfer the bread to a wire rack to cool.   Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

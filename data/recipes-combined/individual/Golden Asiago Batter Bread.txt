       227g lukewarm milk 14g dried leeks (or dried chives) 326g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 46g potato flour 21g Vermont sharp cheddar cheese powder 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground mustard (optional)  113g coarsely grated Asiago cheese 4 large eggs, room temperature (See "tips," below.) 
    
     Directions   Combine the dried leeks and warm milk. Set aside.  Place the remaining dry ingredients and cheese into a bowl, and whisk together until the cheese is evenly distributed.  Stir in the milk mixture and the eggs, mixing until the dough pulls together.   Let rest for 15 minutes, then stir again briefly; about 30 strokes will do it, if you're mixing by hand.  Spoon the batter into a greased 9" round pan that's at least 2 1/2" to 3" deep. The round pan above is a good choice, or use a large panettone pan, or souffle dish.  Cover the dough with lightly greased plastic wrap or a proof cover, and set it aside to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it reaches the top of the pan.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 48 to 52 minutes, placing it on a lower rack so it has plenty of room to rise as it bakes.   Remove it from the oven when it's a deep, golden brown, turn it out of the pan, and place it on a rack to cool.  Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  If the eggs are cold, the bread will take longer to rise. To warm refrigerator-cold eggs, place them in a bowl of hot water for 5 minutes.

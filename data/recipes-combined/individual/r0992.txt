aside. spread the bread slices out on a flat working surface.  spread
one side of four slices of bread lightly with the prepared mustard.
top each with a slice of cheddar cheese.  butter the remaining four
slices of bread and top each cheese slice with bread, butter side
down.  heat the butter in the skillet or on the griddle.  carefully
dip each sandwich into the egg mixture, coating both sides.  allow
the excess egg mixture to drain back into the bowl.  dip only as many
sandwiches as will lie flat in the skillet or griddle.  cook over low
heat until browned.  turn and brown the other sides.  repeat for the

or griddle to prevent sticking.  or you can place the sandwiches,
after dipping, on a well greased baking sheet and brown in the oven

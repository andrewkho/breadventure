Tomato Bread
    
    This bright-orange loaf, redolent of tomato and garlic, is wonderful fresh from the machine, or sliced thin, toasted, and served with sweet butter or cream cheese. Use it for grilled-cheese sandwiches toast a thick slice, or cover it with anchovy fillets, and dribble olive oil lightly over them. Sounds pretty good to us. It's written for a 1 1/2-lb. or larger machine; simply halve recipe for a smaller machine.

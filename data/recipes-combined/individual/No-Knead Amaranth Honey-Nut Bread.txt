No-Knead Amaranth Honey-Nut Bread
    
    Sweet, nutty, and earthy in flavor, and soft and moist yet crusty in texture, this bread hits all the right buttons when it comes to a hearty loaf. The honey both sweetens and helps to develop the crust's deep-dark brown color; while the amaranth and nuts, along with the dough's long, slow rise, enhance the finished loaf's complex flavor.
    
       397g room-temperature water (about 75°F) 85g honey 50g vegetable oil 447g High-Gluten Flour or King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 103g amaranth flour 2 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast 170g chopped walnuts 
    
     Directions   Mix together the water, honey, oil, flours, salt, and yeast in a large bowl. Stir, then use your hands (or a stand mixer) to mix and form a sticky dough.  Work the dough just enough to incorporate all the flour (or mix for several minutes in a stand mixer), then work in the nuts.  Cover the bowl and let the dough rest at room temperature overnight, or for at least 8 hours; it'll become bubbly and rise quite a bit, so use a large bowl.  Next day, lightly grease a 4-quart round lidded baking crock or Dutch oven.  Turn the dough out onto a floured work surface, and form it into a round loaf to fit your pan.   Place the loaf in the pan, smooth side up. Cover the pan with its lid, and let the loaf rise at room temperature for about 1 hour, until the dough has become puffy and fills the pan about 3/4 full.  Place the pan (with its lid) into a cold oven, and set the oven temperature to 450°F.  Bake the bread for 45 to 55 minutes, then remove the lid and continue to bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, until the bread is deep brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers about 205°F.  Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out onto a rack, and allow it to cool before slicing.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  For a denser, Omega-3-packed loaf, add 1/4 cup golden flax meal and 1/4 cup chia seeds.

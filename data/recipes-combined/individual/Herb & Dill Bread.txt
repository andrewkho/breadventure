     Directions   Put the yeast, flour, sugar and salt in the pan of a bread machine.  Put the egg and oil in a 1-cup measure, then add enough milk to make 1 cup. Pour this mixture into the bread pan.  Add all of the remaining ingredients at once, or wait until your bread machine prompts you to do so.  Bake the bread on a normal cycle.  Store the bread, well-wrapped, for up to 5 days at room temperature or up to 3 months in the freezer.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  This recipe is best made in a smaller bread machine.Feel free to reduce the yeast by as much as half, but allow for a slightly longer rise time.

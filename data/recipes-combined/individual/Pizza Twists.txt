Pizza Twists
    
    Savory twists to enjoy by themselves, or to dip in pizza sauce or marinara.
    
     Dough  170g lukewarm water (about 110°F) 25g olive oil 1 tablespoon Pizza Dough Flavor, optional  1 teaspoon instant yeast 1/2 teaspoon salt 206g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 35g Hi-maize Fiber  Filling  28g Vermont cheese powder 1 teaspoon pizza seasoning or the dried herbs of your choice 14g melted butter 14g water 57g finely shredded mozzarella or pizza-blend cheese 14 gram) olive oil or garlic oil 
    
     Directions   Mix, then knead the dough ingredients to make a smooth, elastic dough, about 5 to 10 minutes.   Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it with lightly greased plastic wrap, and let it rise until it's doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.   Make the filling by stirring together the cheese powder, Pizza Seasoning, melted butter, and water.   Grease a baking sheet, or line it with parchment.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Pat, then roll it into a 20" x 10" rectangle.   Spread the dough with the filling, leaving 1/2" free of filling along the long edges. Sprinkle with the shredded cheese.   Fold the dough in half so the long sides (free of filling) meet. Press together by rolling over the dough with a rolling pin. Cut into twenty 1" slices.   Place the slices about 1" apart on the prepared pan, twisting them as you lay them down. Brush with olive oil or garlic oil.   Cover and let rise for about 1 hour, or until puffy. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake the twists for 20 to 25 minutes, or until they're light golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and serve warm with pizza sauce or marinara, if desired.   Yield: 20 twists.

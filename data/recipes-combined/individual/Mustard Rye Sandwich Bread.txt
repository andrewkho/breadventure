     Directions   To make the dough: Mix and knead all of the ingredients together — by hand, mixer, or using the dough cycle on a bread machine — to make a smooth, but quite sticky dough.  Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover it, and let it rise for an hour; it'll become puffy, but probably won't double in bulk.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and gently deflate it.   Shape it into an 8" log, and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.   Cover the pan, and allow the loaf to rise until it's crested a good inch or so over the lip of the pan. This should take between 60 and 90 minutes; give it more time if necessary. This bread doesn't have much oven spring, so you want to get as full a rise in the pan, before baking, as possible.  To bake the bread: Preheat the oven to 350°F. Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers 190°F.   Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool.   Store bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Polysaccharides in pumpernickel called pentosans are responsible for the stickiness of this dough; they're the reason rye dough will never attain the silky, delightful finish that wheat-based doughs are capable of.

Bread Machine Pandoro
    
    Pandoro is a classic Italian Christmas bread. This bread, which will fill your kitchen with the scent of lemon as it bakes, is high-rising and sports a wonderful domed top. Its shape makes it perfectly suited to the tall pans that are a feature of most bread machines.
    
       142g water 57g unsalted butter 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/8 teaspoon lemon oil or 1 teaspoon grated lemon rind 2 large eggs 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 64g sugar 418g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 14g instant yeast 43g golden raisins, coarsely chopped with 7g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients, including the raisin mix, into the pan of your bread machine.  Program the machine for Basic White Bread, Light Crust, and press Start.  Check the dough with about 10 minutes remaining in the final kneading cycle, and adjust the consistency by adding flour or water as needed. It should be smooth and supple.   Allow the machine to complete its cycle, and place the finished bread on a rack to cool.   Store the pandoro, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Chopping the raisins with the flour is easily done in a blender or small food processor.

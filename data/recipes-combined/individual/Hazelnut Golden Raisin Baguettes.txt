Hazelnut Golden Raisin Baguettes
    
    These baguettes feature a blend of fruit, nuts, and the distinctive licorice taste of fennel. Leave out the fennel if you like, but it really does lend a mild but interesting flavor to these loaves.   
    
     Sponge  120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or French-Style Flour 28g rye flour (white, medium, or pumpernickel) or King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour 283g water 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast  Dough  all of the sponge 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or French-Style Flour 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1/2 teaspoon instant yeast  142g toasted, coarsely chopped hazelnuts 128g golden raisins 1 tablespoon fennel seeds, lightly toasted (optional) 
    
     Directions   To make the sponge: Mix together, cover, and set aside to rest for 12 to 24 hours at room temperature; the longer you let it sit, the more of a tang your bread will have.   To make the dough: Mix and knead together the sponge, flour, salt, and yeast for 8 to 10 minutes, until the dough becomes smooth and elastic.  Add the hazelnuts, raisins and fennel seeds, kneading until everything is evenly incorporated.   Place in a greased bowl, cover, and allow to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until nearly doubled in bulk.   Gently deflate the dough, and divide it in half.  Form it into logs about 10" to 12" long, and place them on baking sheets (or in a couche). Cover, and let rise for 1 hour.   If baking on a stone: Preheat the oven and stone for 30 minutes at 475째F.   Just before placing the loaves in the oven, cut three or four diagonal slices down the center of each, and spritz with water.   Place the loaves on the stone, then reduce the oven heat to 375째F. Bake the baguettes for 20 to 24 minutes, until they're medium brown.   If baking on sheet pans: Preheat the oven to 450째F.   Prepare the baguettes for the oven as directed above, and bake for 10 minutes.  Reduce the oven heat to 375째F and continue baking for an additional 10 to 12 minutes.   Store bread, well-wrapped, for 2 days at room temperature. Freeze for up to a month.

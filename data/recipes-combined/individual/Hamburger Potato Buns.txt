Hamburger Potato Buns
    
    We love the simplicity of these buns, which are ideal for serving a crowd of hungry burger fans. It's the perfect bun for our Blue Cheese Stuffed Burgers.
    
     Dough  361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 35g potato flour or dry potato flakes 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 25g sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons instant yeast 57g unsalted butter 227g lukewarm water  Topping  14g unsalted butter, melted  
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a soft dough.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until it's almost doubled in bulk.  Turn the dough onto a lightly greased surface, gently deflate it, and divide it into 6 pieces. Roll each piece into a ball.   Place the balls into the greased cups of a hamburger bun pan, flattening gently. Or place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, leaving about 2" to 3" between them; flatten gently.  Cover and let rise until the buns have doubled in size, 60 to 90 minutes. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the buns for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they're light golden brown.   Remove them from the oven, and brush them with melted butter, if desired.   Transfer the buns to a rack to cool. Store buns, well-wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.  Yield: 6 buns.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  For an aromatic, crunchy, seedy topping for your buns, just before baking the buns, brush them with egg wash (1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon of water) and top with a sprinkling of Everything Bagel Topping.

1 pkg yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
1 1/4 cup tepid water
4 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon all-purpose flour
2 teaspoon salt
2  eggs, lightly beaten
2 tablespoon butter, melted
1  egg yolk
1  poppy seeds

method: combine the yeast and sugar in the mixing bowl of a table top
mixer and dissolve in 1-1/4 cup tepid water.  in a large mixing bowl,
sift together the flour and the salt.  add the eggs and melted and
cooled butter and 2/3 of the flour mixture to the yeast mixture.  mix
at speed 2 for 2 minutes, then add the flour up to the point that the
dough leaves the sides of the bowl.  grease large bowl and place the
dough in it turning to grease the top.  cover with a kitchen towel.
let rise in a draftless warm place for approximately 1 hour.  take
2/3 of the dough and make a braid with it about 1 foot long.  place
it on a lightly greased cookie sheet. put kitty-corner, squarely in
the middle. brush braid with the egg yolk. take the rest of the dough
and make a smaller braid only 10 inches long. take the side of your
hand and press firmly along the top of the larger braid (to keep
smaller braid in place as it is baking). place smaller braid on top.
brush the top braid with egg yolk and sprinkle liberally with poppy
seeds.

let rise in a warm place again, about 40 minutes; don't let it rise
too much.  bake in preheated oven at 375 degrees f. for 40 to 45
minutes. check after about 25 minutes to see that it isn't getting
too dark. if it is, place a piece of foil over it for the balance of
the baking time. wrap leftovers, if any, in wax paper.

cake-like corn bread

breads

4 1/2 oz (half box) corn bread mix
4 1/2 oz (half box) yellow cake mix
1  egg
1/2 cup milk

preheat oven to 350 degrees.  mix all four ingredients together, stir
until smooth and most of the lumps are gone. pour into 8 or 9 inch
round cake pan.  bake at 350 degrees about 20 minutes or until top is
golden brown.

note...since you are using only 1/2 box of yellow cake mix and corn
bread mix, combine the other half together and store in zippered
plastic bag until the next time you make corn bread.

note 2...i use the small boxes of jiffy corn bread mix and jiffy
yellow cake mix. submitted by moorefam@one.net on tue, 21 nov 1995

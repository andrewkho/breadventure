Plain Wraps
    
    Thicker than a traditional tortilla, these comforting rounds of plain, soft, white bread are ideal for cradling all manner of flavorsome fillings. For spinach or tomato wraps, add 3 tablespoons spinach powder or tomato powder, respectively, to the ingredients below.
    
       361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 21g vegetable shortening or 28g lard 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon yeast, instant or active dry 18g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 227g water 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — kneading to form a smooth and supple dough.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes.  Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and divide it into 10 pieces, each weighing approximately 2 ounces (56g).  Form each piece of dough into a ball.  Let the balls rest, covered, for 10 to 15 minutes; this resting period will make them much easier to roll out.  Roll each ball of dough into an 8" to 9" diameter circle (the thinner the better).  Before frying the first wrap, lightly grease your pan or griddle, or spray it with non-stick pan spray. (If your griddle or pan is well-seasoned, you won't have to use any additional grease after this first little bit.)  Fry each wrap for 1 to 2 minutes, until bubbles form, turn over, and continue to fry until the wrap feels firm. It'll brown only in spots.  Stack the wraps one atop the other and cover them with a cloth to keep them warm, if you're going to be serving them immediately. Cool completely before storing.  Store at room temperature for 3 days, or freeze for up to a month.

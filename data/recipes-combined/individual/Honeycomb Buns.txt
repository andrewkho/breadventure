Honeycomb Buns
    
    These brioche-style buns, with their drizzle of honey glaze, are over-the-top decadent. Serve them warm at breakfast, or with afternoon tea.
    
     Buns  361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon salt 43g honey 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 113g warm milk 57g unsalted butter, melted 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract  Glaze  28g unsalted butter 85g honey 
    
     Directions   To make the buns: Combine the flour, salt, honey, and yeast.    Mix in the milk, melted butter, eggs, and vanilla. Knead to make a smooth, elastic dough.    Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rest for 60 minutes.    Grease a honeycomb cake pan or mini-muffin pan.    Gently deflate the dough, and divide it into 19 equal pieces (20 pieces if you're using a mini muffin pan).    Pat each piece of dough into the separate cups of the pan. Allow the buns to rest, covered, until just about doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes.    Towards the end of the resting time, preheat the oven to 350Â°F.    Bake the buns for 20 to 22 minutes, until they're a light golden brown. Remove them from the oven. After 5 minutes, turn them out onto a plate.    To make the glaze: Combine the butter and honey, and microwave for 45 seconds to melt the butter.     Brush the glaze over the hot buns, and let them rest for 5 minutes to allow them to absorb the glaze.  Yield: 19 or 20 buns.

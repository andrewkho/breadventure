Cinnamon-Filled Bread Pudding
    
    Here's an easy-to-make-ahead breakfast for a special morning, featuring the flavor of cinnamon rolls with the extra richness of custard.
    
       74g Baker's Cinnamon Filling 43g water 8 to 10 slices bread, crusts removed; about a 454g loaf  340g milk 113g cream or half & half 5 large eggs 156g maple syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon salt maple syrup and/or confectioners' sugar, to drizzle on top 
    
     Directions   Butter a 1 1/2 to 2-quart baking dish, or spray it with non-stick vegetable oil baking spray.   Mix the cinnamon filling with the water. Spread a thin layer of the filling on one side of each slice of the bread.   Stack the bread in two piles. Use a serrated knife to cut the stacks of bread into slices about 3/4" wide.   Line the bottom of the pan with the stacked slices, piling the remaining bread on top.  Whisk together the milk, cream, eggs, maple syrup, vanilla, and salt.  Pour the custard mixture over the bread, gently pushing the bread down so it absorbs the liquid.   Let sit for an hour or so at room temperature; or overnight in the refrigerator, covered. Just before baking, preheat the oven to 350Â°F.  Bake the pudding for 50 to 60 minutes, until the top is puffy and browned. Remove from the oven, and drizzle with maple syrup or sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. Serve warm.   Yield: about 8 to 10 servings.

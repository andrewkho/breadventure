Whole Wheat Sourdough Bread
    
    We love the combination of sourdough and whole wheat. The tanginess of a fed and active starter complements the inherent nuttiness of the flour. Together the two create a perfectly soft and moist loaf ideal for sandwiches, toast, and just about any other bread-based snack.
    
       227g ripe (fed) sourdough starter  255g lukewarm water 340g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour or Premium 100% Whole Wheat Flour 14g whole grain bread improver, optional; for a better, faster rise 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon instant yeast 25g vegetable oil 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, mixing until a shaggy dough forms.  Let the dough rest, covered, for 20 minutes, then knead until fairly smooth and slightly sticky.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise until almost doubled, about 60 to 90 minutes.  Gently fold the dough over a few times on a lightly floured work surface.   Shape it into an 8" log, and place it in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Cover the loaf and let it rise until it's crowned 1" over the rim of the pan, about 60 to 90 minutes.  Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350째F  Bake the bread for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the loaf is golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers 205째F to 210째F.  Remove the bread from the oven, let it sit in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn it out onto a rack to cool.   
    
     Tips from our bakers  This bread gets a wonderfully hearty crust when made in our Emile covered bread loaf baker. Bake the loaf in a preheated 350째F oven with the lid on for 35 minutes then remove the lid and bake for 5 to 10 minutes longer.

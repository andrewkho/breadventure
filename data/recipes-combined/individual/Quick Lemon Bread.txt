Quick Lemon Bread
    
    This bread is a treat for anyone who loves the fresh, bright taste of citrus. Made doubly moist by the lemon-sugar glaze applied after it comes out of the oven, it's reminiscent of poke cake (remember that?). It's sweet enough to serve for dessert, yet tart enough to go well in a brunch breadbasket with other muffins and breads.
    
     Bread  57g fresh lemon juice 170g buttermilk or yogurt 1/2 teaspoon lemon oil OR 1 teaspoon grated lemon rind 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 85g butter, softened 198g sugar 2 large eggs  Glaze  57g fresh lemon juice 99g sugar 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.  To make the bread: Mix the buttermilk or yogurt with the lemon juice and lemon oil, and set aside.  Mix the flour, baking powder, and salt, and set aside.  Beat together the butter and sugar until combined.  Add the eggs one at a time, beating well after each addition.  Add the dry ingredients to the butter mixture alternately with the buttermilk mixture.  Pour into the pan, and bake for about 50 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  To make the glaze: While the bread is baking, whisk together the glaze ingredients to dissolve the sugar.  Remove the bread from the oven, and poke it all over with a cake tester, skewer, ice pick, or other long, thin tool.  While the loaf is hot, drizzle it gradually with the glaze, stopping periodically to allow it to soak in. Set it aside, and let it cool in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes.  Remove the bread from the pan, and allow it to cool completely before slicing. The bread will keep for 5 days on the counter, covered. Freeze for up to 3 months.

      ----bread----
2 cup rye sour
1/4 cup water
1/2 pkg dry yeast
1/2 tablespoon salt
2 cup bread flour
1/2  egg
1/2 tablespoon caraway seeds

for the starter: put onions in cheese cloth.  mix remaining
ingredients, submerge cheese cloth into it, and let sit overnight (in
bread pan). in the morning, remove the onions. there should be 2 cups
of starter in the pan -- just what we need. add remaining ingredients
~- use up to 1/4 cup more flour if needed to get the dough ball to
the right consistency. also the 1/4 cup water should be added slowly,
using judgment. about 20 minutes before baking slash the top and
brush with the egg beaten with 1 tbs of water and sprinkle with
caraway seeds. ~--

     Directions   Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Program for white or basic bread, light setting, and press Start.  Check the dough's consistency about 7 minutes after the kneading cycle begins, adding additional water or flour to form a smooth, soft ball of dough.  Allow the machine to complete its cycle. Remove the bread when it's done, and let it cool completely before slicing.  Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

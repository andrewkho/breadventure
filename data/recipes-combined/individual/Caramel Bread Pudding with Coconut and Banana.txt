Caramel Bread Pudding with Coconut and Banana
    
    As far as comfort foods go, bread pudding ranks way up there. We've enhanced this one with gooey caramel, fresh bananas, and coconut.
    
       283g to 312g white sandwich bread (about half a loaf, 283 to 12 slices), cubed 142g caramel from a block, cut into 1/2" pieces 227g bananas, peeled and sliced 8 large egg yolks 198g sugar 283g milk 283g heavy cream 50g coconut milk powder 43g coconut flakes 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F.   Place the bread cubes on a baking sheet, and toast until slightly crusty on the outside but still soft on the inside, about 10 minutes.   Transfer the bread a large bowl, add the caramel pieces, and toss to combine.  Grease eight 5-ounce or 6-ounce ramekins, and place them on a baking sheet. Line the bottoms of the ramekins with the banana slices.  Beat the egg yolks and sugar together until pale and creamy.  Heat the milk and cream to simmering, then add the coconut milk powder, stirring until dissolved.   Add the milk mixture to the egg yolks/sugar, stirring until combined.  Pour the milk/egg mixture (custard) into the bowl with the bread cubes. Allow the bread to absorb the custard for 15 minutes.   Transfer the bread/custard to the prepared ramekins; it’ll be the consistency of lumpy batter. Sprinkle coconut flakes on top of each of the puddings.   Bake the puddings for 30 minutes, until the coconut is golden. Let the puddings rest for 10 minutes, then serve warm.  Yield: 8 individual puddings.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  This pudding can also be made in a 9" square cake pan. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the center looks set (no longer liquid).

Classic Pretzels
    
    These old-fashioned "Philadelphia-style" pretzels are almost like bagels — smooth and shiny on the outside, chewy within.
    
     Pretzel Dough  11g sugar 454g room-temperature water 11g active dry yeast or 2 teaspoons instant yeast 340g King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour 2 teaspoons non-diastatic malt powder or sugar 11g salt 298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour  Water Bath  1361g water 28g baking soda  Topping  pretzel salt or kosher salt 
    
     Directions   Mix the sugar, water and yeast; stir to dissolve. (If you're using instant yeast, skip this step, simply combining all of the ingredients at once.) Add the white wheat flour, malt, salt, and enough unbleached flour to make a soft (but not sticky) dough.  Knead well, place in a bowl, and let rise until puffy, about 60 minutes.   Divide the dough into 16 pieces. Roll each piece into a log, and shape the logs into pretzels. (See "tips", below.)  Preheat the oven to 450°. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) a baking sheet.  In a large pot, boil together 6 cups of water and 2 tablespoons baking soda. Put 4 pretzels at a time into the boiling water, and cook for 1 minute. Transfer boiled pretzels to the baking sheet.  Sprinkle the pretzels with salt, and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the pretzels are well-browned.  Store, well-wrapped, for up to 3 days on the counter, and freeze for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  To shape the pretzels, take each rope and make a U-shaped loop with fairly short ends. Cross the rope near the ends, twist the ends a second time, and fold the twist into the middle of the U. Press the ends of the rope on either side of the bottom center of the loop, creating the classic pretzel shape.

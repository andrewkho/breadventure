Honey Challah with Flax
    
    Flax improves the nutritional profile of this rich, tender bread. To our surprise, flax also made the bread more tender and delicious he extra fiber and omega-3 fatty acids turned out to be a side benefit.
    
       142g lukewarm water 50g vegetable oil 43g honey 2 large eggs 298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 43g whole flax meal 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead them, by hand, mixer, or bread machine, until you have a soft, smooth, slightly sticky dough.   Allow the dough to rise, covered, for about 2 hours, or until it's puffy and nearly doubled in bulk.   Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.   Divide the dough into three equal pieces for a three-strand braid. Roll each piece into a rope, and braid together.   Gently pick up the loaf, and place it on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.   Cover the loaf with lightly greased plastic wrap or a proof cover, and let rise till very puffy, 60 to 90 minutes. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.  For a classic, dark brown, shiny crust, whisk together an egg and 1 tablespoon water and brush this glaze over the risen loaf. Sprinkle with sesame or poppy seeds if desired.  Bake the challah for 22 to 27 minutes until crust is shiny and brown, the loaf sounds hollow when the bottom is tapped, and the inside reads between 190°F and 200°F. Remove the bread from the oven, and place on a rack to cool.  Yield: 1 large loaf.

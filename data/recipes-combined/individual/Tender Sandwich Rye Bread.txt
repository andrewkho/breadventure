Tender Sandwich Rye Bread
    
    This moist, easy-to-slice bread fairly sings with "deli rye" flavor. And don't worry-no one will ever guess that sauerkraut's the secret ingredient that makes this bread special.
    
       241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 106g white rye flour 32g pumpernickel 46g potato flour or potato flakes 8g caraway seeds 1 1/2 teaspoons each yellow and black mustard seeds  1 1/2 teaspoons salt 11g sugar 2 teaspoons instant yeast 57g sour pickle juice or dill pickle juice 397g can sauerkraut, drained and wrung dry 50g vegetable oil 149g water additional mustard seeds to sprinkle on loaves (optional) 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, and mix and knead to form a smooth (though sticky) dough.  Let the dough rise in a lightly greased bowl until it's almost double in bulk, 60 minutes or so.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly oiled or lightly floured surface, and shape it into a log.  Place the log in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan, cover the pan with a proof cover or greased plastic wrap, and allow the loaf to rise until it's reached the edge of the pan. This will take 1 to 2 hours.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, or until it's a deep, golden brown and its internal temperature registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer. If the bread appears to be browning too quickly, tent it with aluminum foil, shiny side up, for the final 15 minutes of baking.  Remove the bread from the oven, take it out of the pan, and allow it to cool on a wire rack.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

Sopa Paraguaya (Paraguayan Cornbread)
    
    Paraguayan cornbread is a dense, very moist, flavorful dish that is occasionally prepared using the drippings from a roast chicken, much like a Yorkshire pudding is made with beef fat. Lacking a chicken or beef drippings, butter and oil stand in as substitutes in this hearty dish, which can accompany chili, stews and soup on a cold winter night. It's also a nutritional powerhouse: one serving has practically all the whole grains you're supposed to be getting per day, there's lots of protein from the cheese, and with a couple of minor tweaks it can be made with very little cholesterol.  
    
       14g unsalted butter 11g corn or vegetable oil 156g diced onion 35g each diced red and green pepper 206g whole cornmeal 227g milk 25g granulated sugar 113g low-fat cottage cheese 2 large eggs 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon pepper 2 teaspoons baking powder 184g fresh or frozen corn kernels 113g Monterey or pepperjack cheese, grated 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Grease a 9" x 9" pan that's at least 2" deep, or a shallow 2-quart casserole dish.  In a medium skillet over medium heat, melt the butter and pour in the oil.  Add the onions and cook until translucent, stirring occasionally.  Add the peppers and cook for 1 more minute. Remove from the heat and cool to room temperature.  In a large bowl, combine the cornmeal and milk.  Stir in the sugar, cottage cheese, eggs, salt, pepper, and baking powder.  Stir in the corn kernels and cooled onion mixture.  Stir in the cheese, and then transfer the batter to the prepared pan.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes, until the center doesn't wobble when lightly touched with your finger.   Remove from the oven, serve warm.  Store, well-covered in the fridge for up to 5 days.

     Dough  418g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or 398g Pastry Flour Blend 50g granulated sugar 35g Bakers' Special Dry Milk 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 170g water 2 large eggs 57g unsalted butter, softened 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1/8 teaspoon Fiori di Sicilia or 1 teaspoon vanilla extract or Buttery Sweet Dough Flavor  Topping  11g cinnamon 49g Sticky Bun Sugar or 99g granulated sugar 85g shredded unsweetened coconut 85g pecans or walnuts, diced  Glaze  57g unsalted butter, melted 39g light corn syrup 99g granulated sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
    
     Directions   Combine the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — mixing and kneading until you have a soft, sticky dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 2 1/2 to 4 hours, or until it's puffy.   Lightly grease a 12-cup bundt-style pan, or monkey bread tube pan.  Cut the dough into 1" to 2" pieces, and roll into balls.  Mix all of the topping ingredients together and toss with the balls.  Place the dough balls in the greased pan.   To make the glaze: Bring the butter, corn syrup, and sugar to a boil.  Boil the mixture for 2 minutes. Add the vanilla.  Pour the glaze over the dough balls, covering them well.  Cover the pan, and let the bread rise until it's quite puffy, about 1 hour.  Toward the end of the rise, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes, until it's golden brown and the syrup is bubbling at the sides.  Let the bread cool in the pan for 8 minutes.  Invert the pan onto a serving platter, and let it rest for 10 minutes to allow the glaze to drizzle down over the bread.  Remove the pan and serve warm.  Store any leftover bread, covered, at room temperature for up to 5 days.

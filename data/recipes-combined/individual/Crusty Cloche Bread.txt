Crusty Cloche Bread
    
    This high-rising, chewy bread takes full advantage of a covered cloche stoneware baker.
    
       283g lukewarm water 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 tablespoon Pizza Dough Flavor 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 25g olive oil 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 67g Hi-maize Fiber* *Substitute 1/2 cup King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour for the 1/2 cup Hi-maize, if desired. 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead everything together to make a smooth, slightly sticky dough.   Cover the dough, and let it rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until almost doubled.  Gently deflate the dough, shape it into a ball, place in a cloche baker, and cover with the lid.  Let the dough rise for 30 to 45 minutes, until it's almost doubled in size.  Slash the top of the loaf several times, cover with the lid, and place the cloche in a cold oven.   Set the oven temperature to 400Â°F; bake the bread for 35 minutes, covered.  Remove the lid, and bake the bread until it's golden brown, another 5 to 10 minutes.  Take it out of the oven, and transfer the bread to a rack to cool.  Yield: 1 large loaf.

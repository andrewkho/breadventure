Pane di Calitri
    
    A distinctive, earthy loaf made with a blend of flour, pane de Calitri descends from a family recipe from Campania, Italy. 
    
       602g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 120g French-Style Flour 248g durum flour 25g pumpernickel 11g vital wheat gluten 794g warm water 11g instant yeast 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon kosher salt herbes de Provence or rosemary, minced, for topping sea salt, for topping 
    
     Directions   In a large bowl, whisk together the flours and gluten.  Stir together the yeast and water in a large mixing bowl, add the salt, then gradually mix in the flours, leaving the dough fairly slack (wet). Mix for 12 to 14 minutes.  Transfer the dough to a well-floured board and knead until it's smooth.  Divide it in half, and place each half in a 1-gallon plastic food bag, closing the top. Place each bag of dough in a heavy bowl, and put the bowls in the oven with the oven light on for 1 hour.  Gently deflate the dough, and let it rise in the oven for an additional hour. The dough should be quite puffy.  Preheat your oven to 500°F for at least 20 minutes.  Remove the dough from the bags and divide each piece in half. Form each piece into a log approximately 1 1/2" thick and 8" in diameter.  Let the logs rest for 5 minutes, then place them on a floured peel, slash the top of each 3 times lengthwise, and spray each with cool water. Sprinkle some herbes de Provence or rosemary, then sea salt, on top.  Slide the bread onto the stone, reduce the temperature to 430°F, and bake for about 30 minutes.  Remove the bread from the oven when it's a deep golden brown.  The loaves may be stored well-wrapped at room temperature for 5 days or frozen for 3 months.

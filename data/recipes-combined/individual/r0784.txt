delicate whole-wheat pasta

breads

1 cup flour, whole-wheat pastry
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup flour, unbleached
2  eggs
2 teaspoon olive oil
2 tablespoon water; (more as needed)

sift flours and salt together into a large mixing bowl or food
processor. add the eggs and oil, and work together until you have a
moderately sticky lump (if working by hand) or a grainy mixture (if
working with a food processor). add 2 t. water, and work the dough
until you have a fairly firm lump. add a little more water or flour
as needed to get a good-feeling texture. if working by hand, don't
try to reincorporate the flakes that fall off the main lump. knead
the dough gently for 5 minutes, wrap in a damp dish towel, and let it
rest 30 minutes to an hour. divide the dough into 8 parts and roll
out very thin with a rolling pin or pasta roller. it will thicken and
shrink a bit after the rolling, so roll a little thinner than you
want it to end up. makes 24 lasagne noodles, or enough
spaghetti/fettucine for 8.

yield: 8 servings

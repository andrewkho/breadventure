     Baguettes  113g ripe (fed) sourdough starter  170g lukewarm water 1 teaspoon instant yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour  Topping  425g canned cannellini beans, rinsed and drained 1 pint grape tomatoes, quartered 71g diced red onion 25g olive oil 14g lemon juice 1 tablespoon Pizza Seasoning 25g olive oil, for brushing on baguettes 
    
     Directions   To make the baguettes: Combine all of the dough ingredients, kneading to form a smooth dough.   Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 hour. Refrigerate, covered, for 12 to 18 hours.  Divide the dough in half. Shape each piece into a 15" to 16" baguette, and place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, or into a baguette pan.   Cover the baguettes and let them rise until very puffy, about 3 hours. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425Â°F.  Spritz the baguettes with water, and make three fairly deep diagonal slashes in each.  Bake the baguettes for 25 to 30 minutes, until they're a deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool on a rack.  To make the topping: Combine all of the topping ingredients.   To assemble the bruschetta: Slice the baguettes 3/4" thick on the diagonal. Brush one side of each slice with oil.  Place slices oiled side up on a baking sheet, and broil until the slices are lightly browned, about 2 minutes.   Cool the toasts completely, then spoon a heaping tablespoon of topping onto each one.  Yield: about 30 bruschetta.

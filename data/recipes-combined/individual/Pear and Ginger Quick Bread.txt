Pear and Ginger Quick Bread
    
    This dense, moist quick bread showcases the spicy bite of candied ginger. It's not a high-riser, so don't expect the usual dome-shaped loaf. Instead, this bread rises like a river, even all the way across, and slices into lovely thin rectangles, ideal for spreading with some candied-ginger-spiked cream cheese.  We've used Bosc pears as the fruit here, but peaches, nectarines, plums, bananas, or even applesauce would be just as suitable. We haven't tried it with zucchini, which is probably ubiquitous in everyone's garden right now, but we imagine that, with a suitable increase in sugar, even that might work.
    
       149g sugar 57g butter 1 egg 227 to 255g pear purée, about 1 1/2 pears (See "tips," below.) 120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 46g crystallized ginger 113g finely chopped nuts (pecans or walnuts) 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line with parchment, or lightly grease, an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.   In a large mixing bowl, cream together the sugar and butter, then add the egg, beating until smooth.  Add the pear purée, flour, ground ginger, baking soda, baking powder, salt and vanilla. Beat until smooth.  Stir in the candied ginger and nuts.  Spoon the batter into the pan.   Bake in a for 55 minutes to 1 hour, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.  Remove the pan from the oven, and cool the loaf in the pan for 15 minutes.  Gently remove the loaf from the pan and cool it completely on a wire rack.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  There's no need to peel the fruit; just purée it well in a blender or food processor.

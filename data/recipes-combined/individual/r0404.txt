+++ combine 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the sugar, undissolved yeast and
salt thoroughly in a large bowl.  heat the milk and butter together
until very warm (115-125 degrees f.).  gradually add to the dry
ingredients and beat at medium speed on an electric mixer for 2
minutes, scraping the bowl occasionally.  add 1/2 cup of the flour
and the cheese.  beat fir 2 minutes on high speed on the mixer,
scraping the bowl occasionally.  stir in enough additional flour to
make a stiff but light dough.  turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, 5 to 8 minutes.
place in a greased bowl, turning once to grease the top.  cover with
a dishtowel that has been soaked in hot water and then wrung out
until almost dry.  let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk,
about 1 hour.  punch the dough down and turn out on a lightly floured
surface and shape into a 20-inch rope.  place seam side down in a
buttered 6 1/2 cup ring mold, pinching the ends together.  cover and
let rise in warm place until nearly doubled in bulk, about 35 to 40
minutes. bake in a preheated 350 degree f. oven for 25 to 30 minutes.
remove from the ring mold.
note:  for a softer crust, brush with melted butter while still hot.
crust will become crisp when cool if you do not.

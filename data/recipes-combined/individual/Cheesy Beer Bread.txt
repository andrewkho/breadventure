Cheesy Beer Bread
    
    When the holidays roll around, parties and celebrations become frequent — and sometimes impromptu — occurrences. This bread is a savory treat that can be thrown together for any such occasion. It's best enjoyed warm, so all you have to do is take it out of the oven, and slice and serve — perhaps in cubes — alongside your favorite dipping oil.
    
     Bread  454g King Arthur Unbleached Self-Rising Flour 85g Vermont cheese powder 227g sharp cheddar cheese, cut into 1/2" cubes; we prefer Cabot extra-sharp 454g beer  Topping  57g grated cheddar cheese 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9" to 10" round, 4" deep lidded baking crock or Dutch oven.  In a large bowl, stir together the flour, cheese powder, and cubed cheddar cheese.  Add the beer, stirring until fairly smooth and no dry spots remain.  Spoon the batter into the crock, smoothing the surface. Sprinkle the grated cheese on top.  Cover the crock with the lid and bake the bread for 40 minutes. Uncover the crock, and bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer, until the bread is golden brown on top, and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf reads at least 190°F.  Remove the bread from the oven, and after 10 minutes turn it out onto a rack.   Serve the bread warm or at room temperature. Store at room temperature, well wrapped, for several days; freeze for longer storage.  Yield: one 9" to 10" round loaf.

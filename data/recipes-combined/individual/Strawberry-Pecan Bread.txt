Strawberry-Pecan Bread
    
    This moist, dark loaf looks as if it must contain whole wheat flour, but it's the cinnamon that gives it both its color and its snap. Serve this at breakfast, toasted with butter, or at tea-time, when you can really gild the lily by spreading strawberry preserves on top.
    
       397g granulated sugar* 389g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour* 1 tablespoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking soda 248g vegetable oil* 4 large eggs 1 teaspoon almond extract 283g diced fresh strawberries 142g diced pecans *See "tips," below. 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease two 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pans.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cinnamon, salt, and baking soda.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, eggs, and almond extract.  Add the wet ingredients to the dry mixture, stirring gently to blend.  Fold in the strawberries and pecans.  Spoon the batter into the prepared pans.  Bake the bread for 60 to 70 minutes, tenting the pans lightly with foil after 55 minutes, if the loaves appear to be browning too quickly. When the bread is done, a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean.  Remove the loaves from the oven, and after 5 to 10 minutes turn them out of the pan onto a rack to cool. Cool completely before slicing.  Store leftovers, well-wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  For a lower-sugar, lower-fat, but still very tasty version of this bread, reduce the flour to 3 cups (12 3/4 ounces); the vegetable oil to 1 cup, and the sugar to 1 3/4 cups; and add 2 tablespoons milk or water to the liquid ingredients.

breads, italian

4 cup unbleached flour
2/3  fresh cake yeast,
1  dissolved in 2/3 cup warm
1  water
10 tablespoon olive oil
1/3 cup water
2 1/2 teaspoon salt

mix 2 cups flour with the dissolved yeast.  knead the dough for 10
minutes, either by hand or in the bowl of an electric mixture with a
dough hook.  shape the dough into a ball, and put in an oiled bowl to
rise until doubled in bulk, about 3 hours.

punch down, put the dough on a floured board, and knead again,
incorporating the remaining flour, 1/3 cup olive oil, water, and salt.
knead until dough is smooth and elastic. let rise again in a covered
bowl for another 3 hours.

preheat the oven to 400 degrees.

divide the dough in half and roll out on a well-floured board to
circles or squares 1/2 inch thick. brush with the remaining olive oil
and press the topping of your choice into the top of each circle.
bake on a baking sheet until golden brown, about 20 minutes. serve
warm or at room temperature, cut into wedges, squares, or triangles.

note:  slashes may be made in a decorative or random pattern in the
breads before baking.

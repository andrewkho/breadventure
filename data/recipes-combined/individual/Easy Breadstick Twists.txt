       361g Sir Lancelot Hi-Gluten Flour 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 18g non-diastatic malt powder or sugar 50g olive oil 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 227g water 36g to 72g artisan bread topping, or seeds, toppings, roll-ins, coarse salt, etc., for flavoring breadsticks 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients except the seasonings — by hand, mixer or bread machine — to form a shaggy dough.  Knead the dough, by hand for 10 minutes, or by machine for 5 minutes. Allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead for an additional 10 minutes, until it's smooth and supple. You may also use your bread machine, set on the Dough cycle, to prepare the dough to this point.  Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled work surface, and allow it to rest, covered, for 15 minutes.  Roll it into a 12" x 15" rectangle, allowing it to rest for 10 minutes if it "fights back."  Brush the rectangle with olive oil, and sprinkle it with seasoning. Fold the dough in half crosswise with the seasoning on the inside, brush with additional olive oil, and sprinkle with more seasoning.  Roll it out into a 12" x 15" rectangle, and cut 1/4" wide, 15" long strips. Twist the strips, and place them on lightly oiled or parchment-covered baking sheets.  Let the breadsticks rise, covered, for about 30 minutes, until they look slightly puffy.  Bake the breadsticks in a preheated 375°F oven for 15 to 18 minutes, until golden brown.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 3 days, or freeze for up to a month.

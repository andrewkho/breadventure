cornbread

breads

1 cup white flour
1 cup corn flour or fine cornmeal
2 tablespoon sugar
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
2  eggs
1 cup milk
2 tablespoon melted butter

this batter can also be baked in muffin cups as well as in a loaf pan.
either way, it's good.

preheat oven to 400f. combine the white flour, corn flour or cornmeal,
sugar, baking powder and salt. in a separate bowl, beat the eggs;
then stir in the milk and the butter. pour the wet ingredients into
the dry ones and stir just enough to combine, in about 15-or-16
strokes. overmixing causes the cornbread to be tough. pour into a
buttered baking pan and bake until the cornbread is firm and a
toothpick comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

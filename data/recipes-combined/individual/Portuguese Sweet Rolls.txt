Portuguese Sweet Rolls
    
    You've heard of Portuguese Sweet Bread, right? Well, this takeoff is simply that big, round loaf broken down into smaller puffs, ideal for carrying in a lunchbox (or brown bag). Serve these soft, almost-sweet rolls with jam and Double Devon Cream for a light, simple addition to afternoon tea.
    
       11g instant yeast 113g milk 85g butter 57g water 1 teaspoon salt 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 35g potato flour 2 large eggs 67g sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/4 teaspoon lemon oil or 1 1/2 teaspoons grated lemon peel 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — kneading to make a smooth, shiny, supple dough.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise until puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 90 minutes, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.   Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and divide it into 16 pieces.   Round each piece into a smooth ball. Place the balls in a lightly greased 12" x 12" (sticky bun) pan, or equivalent (two 9" round pans, a 9" x 13" pan, 14" round pan, etc.)   Cover the pan, and allow the rolls to rise for about 1 hour; they should get very puffy.  Bake the rolls in a preheated 325°F oven for 30 minutes, tenting lightly with aluminum foil after the first 20 minutes.   Remove them from the oven when they're golden brown, and transfer them to a wire rack to cool.

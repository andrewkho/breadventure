Grape-Nut Pudding
    
    If you're a New Englander, you'll know that grapenut pudding is a staple of truck stops and diners all over the region. This soft, sweet "nursery food" dessert has much in common with both rice pudding, and tapioca. If you love either of these old-fashioned treats, you'll love this pudding, with its slight hint of nuttiness from the Grape-Nuts® cereal. Serve it warm (or cold) with freshly whipped cream or ice cream (rum raisin is a wonderful match), if desired.
    
       454g milk 227g cream — half & half, light, whipping, or heavy 3 large eggs 8g vanilla extract 85g Grape-Nuts cereal 70g to 106g brown sugar, to taste 3g salt 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 325°F. Lightly grease an 8" round cake that's at least 2" deep.  Whisk together the milk, cream, eggs, and vanilla.  Add the Grape-Nuts, brown sugar, and salt, stirring to combine thoroughly.  Pour the mixture into the prepared pan. Set the pan in a larger pan, and pour in warm water to come about 3/4 up the sides of the 8" pan; this "water bath" will allow the custard to cook slowly and stay smooth.   Bake the pudding for 60 minutes; a toothpick inserted into the center will come out clean.  Remove the pudding from the oven. Allow the pudding to set for 15 to 30 minutes before serving; or cool completely, then refrigerate.   Spoon individual servings onto plates or into bowls. Top with whipped cream or ice cream, if desired. Refrigerate any leftovers.  Yield: 6 to 8 servings.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  For elegant presentation (even though "elegant grapenut pudding" might be an oxymoron), cut pudding into rounds with a biscuit cutter and serve on a plate, rather than in a bowl.Why the range in sugar? Some people prefer their pudding quite sweet; others, knowing they'll be adding whipped cream or ice cream, prefer it a bit less sweet.

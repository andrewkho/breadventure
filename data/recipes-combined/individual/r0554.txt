cinnamon raisin bread

breads

1 pkg yeast
2 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1 1/4 cup warm milk
3 cup bread flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon butter
2/3 cup raisins

the raisins get chopped up (you can add them later if you like after
the first rise) but it smells heavenly and tastes wonderful to wake
up with this hot out of the baker! note: no instructions provided.
use normal bread making procedures.

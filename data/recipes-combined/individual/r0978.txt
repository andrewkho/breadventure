foolproof sourdough starter 3

breads, sourdough

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
2 1/2 cup warm water
2 1/2 cup white flour, preferably unbleached

let yeast dissolve in 1/2 cup warm water in a pottery or glass bowl,
then stir in flour and 2 cups warm water; mix well. pour into
plastic, glass, or crockery container, cover, and let stand 3-5 days
in a warm place - near but not directly over the stove pilot light is
a good choice.

when the mixture is ready to use, it may be stabilized by being kept
in the refrigerator.  when the liquid rises to the top, mix gently
with a fork to blend before using.

feed the starter every 5 days by mixing in 1/2 cup flour and 1/3 cup
warm water.

each time the starter is used, reserve at least 1 cup, replacing the
amount you have taken out with equal amounts of flour and water.

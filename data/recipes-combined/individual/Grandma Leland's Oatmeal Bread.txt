Grandma Leland's Oatmeal Bread
    
    Molasses and oatmeal combine to make this deep golden-yellow loaf, moist and chewy with just a hint of bite from the oats. This is terrific sandwich bread. 
    
     Dough  454g milk 149g rolled oats 1 1/2 teaspoons shortening 14g salt 227g lukewarm water 11g active dry yeast 170g molasses 723g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour  Topping  28g butter, melted 
    
     Directions   Scald the milk, and stir in the rolled oats, shortening and salt. Let sit until lukewarm.  Dissolve the yeast in the water. Add to the oat mixture.  Stir in the molasses and the flour.  Beat in the bowl for 5 minutes, using the flat paddle of an electric mixer, or beat by hand with a spoon.  Let dough rise for 1 1/2 hours, or until puffy.  Press the dough down, and spoon into two lightly greased 10" x 5" bread pans. Let rise until almost doubled, about 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.  Bake for 30 minutes, or until loaves are brown and firm.  Remove from the oven and take the bread from the pans.  Brush with the melted butter, if desired.  Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  This recipe comes to us from Anna Leland Perkins of East Bridgewater, Mass. Anna suggests adding more flour and kneading the dough, rather than setting it aside to rise as a batter.

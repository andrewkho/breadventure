Panettone
    
    Here's a quick and easy recipe for panettone, a lovely Italian holiday bread.
    
       1 tablespoon active dry yeast or instant yeast 74g lukewarm water 50g granulated sugar 3 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon freshly grated lemon peel (or 1/4 teaspoon lemon oil) 1 teaspoon salt 113g unsalted butter, softened 298g to 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 170g golden raisins 
    
     Directions   In a large bowl, dissolve the yeast in the warm water. Stir in the sugar, eggs, vanilla, lemon, salt and butter; beat well.  Gradually stir in the flour, adding just enough flour to make a soft dough.  Transfer dough to well-floured work surface and knead, adding more flour if necessary, until dough is smooth.   Place dough in a well-greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap or a towel, and let rise until nearly doubled in bulk, about 30 to 45 minutes.  Punch dough down, and place on well-floured work surface. Knead in the raisins.   Shape the dough into a ball and place in a well-buttered 2-quart casserole pan. Set aside to rise until doubled in bulk, 30 to 45 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 400째F, or 375째F if using a glass pan.  Bake panettone for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350째F (325째F for a glass pan), and bake an additional 30 to 40 minutes. Cover panettone with aluminum foil if it begins to get too brown.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Try this panettone as the base for Panettone Bread Pudding with Lemon Filling. Ideally you'll want the panettone to be slightly stale before using it for pudding, so feel free to enjoy about half of your loaf fresh, reserving the rest for this decadent dessert.

Low-Fat Date-Nut Bread
    
    New England has a long history of steamed breads, including the Boston Brown Bread present with beans and franks at so many winter meals. The steaming method produces a moist, soft loaf, and is well suited to other quick breads.
    
       67g yellow cornmeal 53g rye flour (white, medium, or pumpernickel) 57g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 50g dried buttermilk powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 18g non-diastatic malt powder or 25g sugar 112g chopped dates 85g walnut or pecan pieces 170g molasses 170g water 
    
     Directions   In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together all of the dry ingredients until well-blended.  Stir the molasses into the water, and combine the wet and dry ingredients, mixing just until everything is moistened.  Butter or grease the inside of your 1-pound steamer pan (or equivalent; a pudding steamer, or "1-pound coffee can"-size pan, about 4 1/2" wide and 6" tall, will do the trick).  Spoon the batter into the pan, and cover it with a piece of greased aluminum foil.  Put 2 to 3 inches of water in a covered saucepan taller than your steamer pan, and place the steamer in the saucepan. Bring the water to a simmer.  Cover the pan, and simmer the bread for 3 hours, replenishing with additional simmering water as needed, until the bread is done (a cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean).  Remove the pan from the saucepan, allow it to cool for 30 minutes, then turn the bread out onto a rack to cool completely.  Store, well-wrapped, for up to a week in the fridge, or freeze for up to 3 months.

Flavored Wraps
    
    You don't have to go the takeout route to enjoy wrap sandwiches; flavored wraps are easily made at home.
    
       138g potato flour or potato flakes 361g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 113g water 50g vegetable oil 113g spinach, pur√©ed, or 1/4 cup tomato paste mixed with 57g water 1 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Whisk together the potato and bread flours. Add the water and oil and mix well. Add the remaining ingredients and stir until the mixture forms a ball.  Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and knead it until smooth and elastic. You may do all of this in your bread machine, if desired. Program for manual or dough, and cancel after the first knead.  Refrigerate the dough for 1 hour (or overnight).   Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface. Divide it into eight equal pieces.   Working with one piece at a time, round the dough into a ball, then roll it until it's very thin, about 1/8" thick.  Dry-fry the dough rounds on a hot, ungreased griddle for about 2 minutes on each side. The dough may puff a little, but will become flat again as it cools. As each wrap finishes cooking, transfer it to a wire rack to cool, stacking one wrap atop the other to keep them soft and pliable.  Store the wraps in a plastic bag or airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze them for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Fill the wraps with any kind of sandwich filling, including the traditional egg, chicken, tuna or ham salads; a meat or vegetable-based stir-fry; vegetables/meat/cheese; hummus and chopped vegetables... you get the picture. Wraps are a wonderfully versatile, portable treat.

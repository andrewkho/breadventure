Maple Cornbread
    
    For you Southerners who decry the Northern use of maple sugar in cornbread, read no further; this is a north of the Mason-Dixon line aberration. But to those of you who don't object to a dense, lightly sweetened cornbread, read on; this is just the ticket with a bowl of chili or stew.
    
       120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 138g yellow cornmeal 1 tablespoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 227g milk, whole, skim or 2%, your choice 71g maple syrup 57g melted butter 2 large eggs 
    
     Directions   Preheat your oven to 425Â°F. Lightly grease or oil an 8" x 8" square or 9" round baking pan.   In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder and salt until thoroughly combined.  In a small bowl, or in a large measuring cup, whisk together the milk, maple syrup, melted butter and eggs.   Add the liquid mixture to the dry ingredients and stir just until moistened.    Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and bake the cornbread for about 20 to 25 minutes, until it's lightly browned and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean.  Serve warm, or store, covered, for 3 days at room temperature. Freeze for up to a month.

Artisan Bread Bowls
    
    Hollow out the center of these tasty bread bowls, and fill with stew or chili. 
    
       447g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons salt 57g King Arthur Premium 100% Whole Wheat Flour or 1 7/8 ounces pumpernickel flour 25g olive oil 340g lukewarm water, enough to make a smooth, soft dough 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or 5/8 ounce nonfat dry milk 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead together all of the ingredientsby hand, mixer or bread machinetill you've created a smooth dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 45 minutes; it should become puffy.  Divide the dough into 5 pieces.   Roll each piece into a ball.  Place on a lightly greased or parchment covered baking sheet.   Cover the bread bowls with greased plastic wrap.   Refrigerate for 4 hours (or up to 24 hours); this step will give the bread bowls extra flavor, and a delightfully crisp-chewy texture.  Two or more hours before serving, remove the bread bowls from the refrigerator. Uncover, and let them sit for about 30 minutes while you preheat the oven to 425°F.  Just before baking, slash the top surface of the bowls several times to allow them to expand.   Bake for 22 to 28 minutes, until the bowls are deep brown, and sound hollow when thumped on the bottom.   Remove from the oven, and cool on a rack.

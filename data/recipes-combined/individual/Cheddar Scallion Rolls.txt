       170g lukewarm water 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast or active dry yeast 85g honey 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 28g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 1 1/2 teaspoons dried dill weed, optional 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 113g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 96g scallions (green and white parts), trimmed and finely diced 113g cheddar cheese, Cabot brand preferred 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, and mix and knead — by hand, using a mixer, or in a bread machine set on the manual or dough setting — to make a smooth, supple dough.  Cover the dough, and let it rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it's doubled in size.  Gently deflate the dough, and turn it out onto a lightly greased surface. Divide it into 24 pieces, and roll each piece into a smooth ball.  Space the rolls evenly in two 9" round cake pans, or a 9" x 13" pan. Cover the pan(s), and let the rolls rise for 30 to 45 minutes, until they've puffed a bit. While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake the rolls for 15 to 20 minutes, until they're golden brown and feel firm to the touch. Remove them from the oven, and after 5 minutes carefully turn them out of the pan(s) onto a rack to cool.  Yield: 24 rolls.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  For a satiny, buttery crust, brush the baked rolls with melted butter as soon as they come out of the oven.

Rosemary Cheddar Cheese Bread
    
    We love the combination of rosemary and cheddar cheese, and the two come together nicely in this quick bread.  
    
     Rosemary White Whole Wheat Batter  170g white whole wheat flour or King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 tablespoon dried rosemary 1/2 teaspoon ground sage 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 large egg 113g milk 43g melted butter  Cheddar Cheese Batter  177g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 28g Vermont cheese powder 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon salt 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper, depending on your heat preference 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 large egg 170g milk 43g melted butter 113g grated or shredded cheddar cheese 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9" x 5"  loaf pan.  To make the rosemary batter: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, rosemary, sage, and salt; set aside.  Beat the egg, then add the milk and melted butter. Gradually add the wet mixture to the dry and mix until just combined; the batter will be stiff.  To make the cheese batter: Whisk together the flour, cheese powder, baking powder, salt, cayenne, and black pepper; set aside.  Beat the egg, and add the milk and the butter. Gradually add the dry mixture and the shredded cheese, stirring to combine.  To assemble the loaf: Scoop ping pong-ball sized dollops of the cheese batter into the bottom of the prepared pan, leaving space between in a checkerboard pattern. Scoop the rosemary batter into the bottom of the pan, filling in the bare spaces. Repeat, layering the batter in the pan until it's used up.  Bake the bread for 45 to 50 minutes, until it's nicely browned and a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.   Remove the loaf from the pan, and cool it in the pan for 30 minutes before carefully turning it out onto a rack.   Store well-wrapped for several days at room temperature; freeze for longer storage.

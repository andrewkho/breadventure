Polish Sweet Bread
    
    Sweet bread recipes of all nations involve enriching a dough with fat, milk and sugars to create a softer dough. Definitely not an everyday dining experience, this particular version contains orange flavoring and dried fruit, and is topped with a thin sugar and flour coating.
    
     Dough  227g milk 57g butter 482g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast 67g sugar 1 teaspoon salt 2 large eggs plus 1 yolk (save the white for glaze) 1/4 teaspoon orange oil or Fiori di Sicilia 85g dried cherries, currants, or golden raisins  Topping  25g sugar 21g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 14g butter egg white, from above, lightly beaten 
    
     Directions   In a small saucepan or in the microwave, melt the butter in the milk, and let the mixture cool to lukewarm.  Combine the milk mixture with the remaining dough ingredients, except for the fruit, and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 1/2 hours.   Deflate the dough and knead in the fruit.  Divide the dough in half and form each half into a loaf.  Place the loaves in two lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pans, and let them rise for about 1 1/2 hours, until they've crowned about 1" over the rims of the pans. Alternately, place the shaped loaves on a parchment-lined sheet tray and let them rise until puffy.  Mix the topping sugar, flour, and butter together, brush the tops of the loaves with beaten egg white, then sprinkle each loaf with the topping mixture.   While the bread finishes rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 25 to 30 minutes, until lightly browned.  Remove it from the oven, and cool completely on a wire rack.   Store the bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days. Freeze for up to 3 months.

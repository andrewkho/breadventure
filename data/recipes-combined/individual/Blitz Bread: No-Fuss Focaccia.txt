    Warm, aromatic yeast bread, hot from the oven - with no kneading, AND in under 2 hours? Here it is. Add Pizza Dough Flavor for over-the-top  flavor, and/or cheese powder to turn it into cheese bread.  
    
       25g olive oil (to drizzle into the pan) 340g warm water 35g olive oil (for the dough) 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 418g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 tablespoon instant yeast 4 teaspoons Pizza Dough Flavor, optional 28g Vermont cheese powder, optional Pizza Seasoning, optional 
    
     Directions   Use non-stick vegetable oil spray to lightly grease a 9" x 13" pan. Drizzle about 2 tablespoons olive oil atop the spray; the spray keeps the bread from sticking, while the olive oil gives the bottom crust great flavor and a bit of crunch.  Combine all of the ingredients, and beat at high speed with an electric mixer for 60 seconds.  Scoop the sticky batter into the prepared pan, cover the pan, and let it rise at room temperature for 60 minutes — it should be quite puffy, but not fragile-looking.  While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Gently poke the dough all over with your index finger.  Drizzle it lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle with pizza seasoning, and/or the dried herbs of your choice, if desired.  Bake the bread until it's golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.  Remove it from the oven, wait 5 minutes, then turn it out of the pan onto a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  To make cheese-stuffed bread, add 1 cup of your favorite cheese, diced or crumbled,  to the dough once it's been kneaded for 60 seconds. Crumbled feta, diced cheddar or provolone, and coarsely grated Parmesan are all good choices.Want to make this bread with whole wheat flour? Substitute 1 1/2 cups (6 ounces) whole wheat flour for 1 1/2 cups of the all-purpose flour.

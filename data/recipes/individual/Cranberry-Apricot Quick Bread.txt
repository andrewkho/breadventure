Cranberry-Apricot Quick Bread
    
    This quick bread features dried cranberries, apricots and nuts, nestled in an orange- and cinnamon-scented batter, and baked to a golden brown. If you're planning on serving a turkey during the holidays, this bread is a great accompaniment.
    
       113g butter, at room temperature 159g sugar 1/4 teaspoon orange oil or 2 teaspoons grated orange peel 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1/2 teaspoon nutmeg 3 large eggs 206g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 227g milk 113g dried cranberries 64g dried apricots, diced, or dried slivered apricots 57g pecans or walnuts, chopped, optional 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, cream together the butter, sugar, orange oil or peel, the salt, baking powder and spices until well blended.  Beat in the eggs one at a time, beating until fluffy after each addition.   Stir in the flour, then add the milk 1/4 cup at a time, stirring well after each addition. Gently mix in the cranberries, apricots and nuts.  Spoon the batter into your pan. Bake the bread for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove the bread from the oven, and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing it from the pan to cool completely on a wire rack.  Store, well-wrapped for 5 days on the counter, or freeze for up to 3 months.

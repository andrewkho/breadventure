Date Pudding
    
    Like many old recipes, we thought this was somewhat plain, so we dressed it up a bit with spices. The resulting dark, moist, dense cake (yes, it's really more cake than pudding) is nice just as it is, warm from the oven, or add some whipped cream.
    
       149g pitted, chopped dates 14g butter, melted 2 teaspoons baking soda 198g sugar 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ginger 227g boiling water 57g chopped walnuts or pecans 156g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a 9" round pan.  Combine the dates with the butter, soda, sugar, salt and spices.  Stir in the boiling water, and allow the mixture to cool.  Add the nuts and flour, stirring just to combine.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and bake the pudding in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until it's set but still very moist.  Store, covered, for 5 days in the fridge, or freeze for up to 3 months.

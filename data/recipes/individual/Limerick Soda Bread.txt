Limerick Soda Bread
    
    This bread is simple to put together, and a staple in the bread baskets at Ariel's Restaurant in Brookfield, VT. It has an unusual but enticing hint of fennel, and is loaded with bursts of sweetness from the currants or golden raisins within.
    
       422g king Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 50g sugar 1 teaspoon salt 4 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 18g whole fennel seeds 142g dried currants or golden raisins 1 large egg 454g buttermilk 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Butter and flour, or spray with pan spray, a 10" round cake pan, 10" springform pan, or a 2-quart round casserole dish.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Mix in the fennel seeds and currants or raisins.  Whisk together the egg and buttermilk. Add to the dry ingredients and stir just until combined. Don't over-mix; the batter will be quite stiff.   Spread the batter in the prepared pan. Bake the bread for about 50 minutes, until it's golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and place it on a rack to cool for 15 minutes before tipping it out of the pan onto a rack to cool completely before slicing.   Yield: 40 slices.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  A mixture of half golden raisins and half currants makes a nice presentation.

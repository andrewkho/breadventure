     Directions   Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan and preheat your oven to 350°F.   In a medium-sized mixing bowl combine the flour, flax meal, baking soda, salt, xanthan gum, cake enhancer, cinnamon, and nutmeg and set aside.   In a separate bowl, combine the brown sugar and oil until well-blended. Add the eggs one at a time, beating until well-incorporated.  Stir the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, and beat on medium speed for about 30 seconds, until well combined.  Stir in the banana, coconut, and flavors, and blend well.  Pour the batter into the loaf pan and bake for 45 to 55 minutes, or until the bread's internal temperature reaches 210°F. Allow the bread to cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before turning it out onto a rack. Cool completely before cutting.   Yield: 1 loaf, 16 servings.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  It's often difficult to be sure gluten-free quick breads are fully baked in the middle. A cake tester inserted into the center may come out crumb and batter free before the bread is fully baked; thus, using an instant-read thermometer is a good idea.To make this bread using coconut flour: Reduce the gluten-free flour to 1 1/2 cups; and add 1/2 cup coconut flour along with the flax. Reduce the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup; and substitute 1 teaspoon vanilla extract for the 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon banana flavor. Bake the bread for 55 to 60 minutes, until its internal temperature reaches at least 200°F.

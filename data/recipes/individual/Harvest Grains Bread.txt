Harvest Grains Bread
    
    This nutty, crunchy, whole-grain loaf makes great sandwiches, and is also super at breakfast, toasted and spread with sweet butter or thick marmalade.
    
       298g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 57g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour, organic preferred 18g King Arthur Whole-Grain Bread Improver 74g Harvest Grains Blend 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 28g sugar 2 teaspoons instant yeast 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 283g lukewarm water 43g butter or 35g vegetable oil 
    
     Directions   In a large bowl (or the bucket of your bread machine), combine all of the ingredients until a rough dough forms, then knead (about 10 minutes by hand, 5 to 7 minutes by bread machine) until the dough is smooth and satiny.   Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the dough to rise for 1 hour (or allow the bread machine to complete its cycle). The dough will become somewhat puffy, but probably won't double in bulk.  Shape the dough into a loaf, and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan. Cover the pan with lightly greased plastic wrap, and allow the bread to rise until it's crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan (about 1 to 1 1/2 hours).    Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.   Bake the bread for 35 minutes, or until its interior registers 190°F on a digital thermometer. Remove the bread from the oven, take it out of the pan, and allow it to cool on a rack.

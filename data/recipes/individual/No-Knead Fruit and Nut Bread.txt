No-Knead Fruit and Nut Bread
    
    This bread, full of wholesome goodness, takes just minutes of hands-on preparation. But with all the grains, seeds, nuts, and fruit that go into it, it will taste like you spent hours crafting it. 
    
       425g warm water 113g golden raisins 113g Harvest Grains Blend 170g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 177g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 1 tablespoon whole grain bread improver, optional; for a better rise 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon SAF Red instant yeast 85g chopped pecans or walnuts 
    
     Directions   In a large bowl, combine the water, raisins, and Harvest Grains Blend. Let sit for at least 3 hours, or overnight.  The next day, whisk together the flours, whole grain bread improver, salt, and yeast. Add to the water/fruit mixture; stir to blend.  Use your hands to fold the dough over in the bowl until the flour is incorporated. Add the nuts, and knead the dough for a minute or two, until the nuts are evenly distributed; it will be slightly sticky.  Let the dough rest at room temperature, covered, for 3 hours. Turn it over a few times, cover, and refrigerate for at least 8 hours, or overnight.  Shape the dough into a log, and place it in a well-greased over-sized terra cotta bread pan or 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Cover and let rise at room temperature for about 3 to 4 hours, until noticeably puffy; this loaf's not a high-riser.   Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for about 60 to 70 minutes, until it's golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers about 200°F. Remove the bread from the oven, and after 5 minutes turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool.  Yield: one loaf.

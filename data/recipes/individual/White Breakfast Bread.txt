White Breakfast Bread
    
    Don't think boring here. There are millions of white bread recipes; this one is different. It has a light texture, but is sturdy enough to hold up well with toasting. The addition of butter and milk provide an old-fashioned flavor that's enhanced by toasting.
    
     One (1 1/2-Pound) Loaf  283g water 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 21g butter 25g sugar 14g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dried milk 447g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.   Program for white or basic bread, light setting, and press Start.   Check the dough's consistency about 7 minutes after the kneading cycle begins, adding additional water or flour to form a smooth, soft ball of dough.   Allow the machine to complete its cycle.   Remove the bread when it's done, and let cool completely before slicing.   
    
     Tips from our bakers  While this recipe is written for the bread machine, feel free to make it as you would any yeast bread. Let the kneaded dough rise in the bowl, then shape a loaf and let it rise again in a 9" x 5" pan. Bake the bread a preheated 350Â°F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until it's golden brown and tests done.

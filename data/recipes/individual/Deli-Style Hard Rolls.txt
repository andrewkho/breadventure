Deli-Style Hard Rolls
    
    These hard rolls are crisp on the outside, and light and airy inside, with satisfying chew. Top them with sesame or poppy seeds for that authentic "deli look." And, for the tempting sandwich pictured at right, check out our recipe for Sam's Pulled Pork Sandwich with Coleslaw. 
    
     Dough  43g Hi-maize Fiber 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 tablespoon non-diastatic malt powder or sugar  1 teaspoon salt 1 large egg white 28g unsalted butter or 7/8 ounce vegetable oil 170g lukewarm water 269g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour  Topping  18 to 14g sesame seeds or poppy seeds, or artisan bread topping 
    
     Directions   To make the dough: Mix and knead the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a smooth dough.   Cover the dough and let it rise until it's noticeably puffy, about 1 hour.   Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and divide it into 6 pieces (about 3 1/4 ounces each). Shape into balls.   Dip the top half of each roll into water, then into the seeds.   Place the rolls into the cups of a lightly greased hamburger roll pan, or onto a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Press gently to flatten.   Cover the rolls and let them rise until puffy, 30 to 40 minutes. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 400°F.   Bake the rolls until they're a deep golden brown, 22 to 26 minutes. Remove them from the oven, and cool on a rack.   If desired, just before serving, reheat the rolls in a 375°F oven for 5 minutes or so, to crisp.   Yield: 6 hard rolls.

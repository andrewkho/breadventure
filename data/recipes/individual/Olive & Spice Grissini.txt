Olive & Spice Grissini
    
    Straddling the breadstick versus grissini line, these golden breadsticks can be customized to bake an thicker and chewier American pizzeria-style breadstick. If you're a crispy sort — and would like a tall-but-tasty display on your table — make them a bit thinner in the style of Italian grissini.
    
     Dough  298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 35g olives, drained and chopped 1 teaspoon dried basil 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 teaspoon salt 21g King Arthur Easy-Roll Dough Improver 28g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 35g olive oil 227g lukewarm water  Topping  11g olive oil 32g freshly grated Parmesan cheese 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Prepare several lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheets for the breadsticks.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and roll it into a 10" x 20" rectangle.  Brush the dough lightly with the additional 1 tablespoon olive oil, and sprinkle it with the cheese, rolling it in lightly with a rolling pin.  Use a pizza wheel or sharp knife to cut the dough (the short way) into 1/4" to 1/2" wide strips.  Twist the ends of each strip in opposite directions to make a twisted breadstick, and place on the prepared baking sheets. Let the breadsticks rest, covered, for 30 minutes.  While the breadsticks rest, preheat your oven to 425°F.  Bake in a preheated oven for 12 to 14 minutes, or until they're golden brown.  Store wrapped at room temperature for up to 4 days, or freeze for a month.

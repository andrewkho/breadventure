Savory Pizza Bread
    
    Turn the pizza inside out, and add the traditional seasoning to the bread dough instead. We love this for a twist with a grilled cheese sandwich; add a dish of spicy tomato sauce for dipping.
    
       120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 113g King Arthur Premium Whole Wheat Flour or White Whole Wheat 163g semolina flour 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 14g Pizza Dough Flavor 7g pizza seasoning 14g Vermont cheese powder 25g olive oil or garlic oil 283g lukewarm water 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, and mix until cohesive. Cover the bowl, and let the dough  rest for 30 minutes.  Knead the dough — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until it's smooth, shiny, and elastic.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl and cover the bowl. Allow the dough to rise for 1 to 2 hours, until it's puffy.  Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Gently deflate the dough, and shape it into a 9" log. Place the log in the pan, cover lightly with plastic wrap or a proof cover, and set it aside to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, or until it's crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan.  While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it's golden brown and the center of the loaf reads 190°F on an instant-read thermometer.  Remove the bread from the oven, and after 5 minutes turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool.  Store, well-wrapped, for 3 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

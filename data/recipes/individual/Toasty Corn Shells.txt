Toasty Corn Shells
    
    Crusty on the outside and tender on the inside, try these with your next beach-style meal of clam chowder, steamed crabs, or grilled fish.
    
       177g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 103g yellow cornmeal 2 1/4 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 74g sugar 3 large eggs 149g milk 113g unsalted butter, melted 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease a shell pan or a muffin top pan.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cornmeal, baking powder, salt, and sugar.  In a separate bowl, whisk the eggs and milk until thoroughly combined.  Pour the milk/egg mixture and the melted butter over the dry ingredients, and stir just to combine; don't beat this mixture, or the cakes will be tough.  Using a muffin scoop or spoon, scoop about 1/4 cup of batter into each shell. The shells should be just about half full, maybe a bit less.  Wet your fingers and spread the batter to cover the bottom of the shells, smoothing the top at the same time.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges begin to brown slightly.  Remove from the oven, and let cool in the pan for 5 to 10 minutes before removing from the pan and onto a rack to cool completely.  The shells may be stored well-wrapped at room temperature for 3 days, or frozen for a month.

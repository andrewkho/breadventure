Irish Buttermilk Brown Bread
    
    This 100% whole wheat, craggy "everyday" loaf is enriched with a touch of sugar and a butter-brushed crust. 
    
     Bread  454g King Arthur Irish-Style Wholemeal Flour or King Arthur Premium 100% Whole Wheat Flour 35g sugar 67g buttermilk powder* 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon baking powder 340g water* 1 large egg 57g melted butter or vegetable oil (1 3/4 ounces) *Or substitute 1 1/2 cups buttermilk in place of the water and buttermilk powder.  Topping  14g melted butter 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Grease a 1 1/2 to 2-quart baking dish, or an 8" or 9" cast-iron skillet or cake pan that's at least 1 1/2" deep.  In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar, buttermilk powder, salt, baking soda, and baking powder.  In a smaller bowl, whisk together the water (or buttermilk), egg, and melted butter or oil.   Make a well in the dry ingredients and pour in the liquids. Stir together until blended and no dry spots remain; the dough will be soft and sticky. In fact, it's probably more of a stiff batter than a soft dough.  Scoop the dough into the prepared pan, mounding it in the center. Brush the top with the melted butter. Wait 5 minutes for liquid to be absorbed by the flour before baking.  Bake the bread for 35 to 45 minutes, or until it tests done (a cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean.) Remove it from the oven, and serve warm.  Yield: One loaf, about 8 to 10 servings.

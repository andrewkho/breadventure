Easy Cinnamon Bread
    
    This bread is a cross between a typical baking powder-leavened quick bread, and a yeast bread. The result: a cinnamon coffeecake-tasting loaf that's wonderful served plain, and is incredible toasted.
    
       361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour or 340g Pastry Flour Blend 99g sugar 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 teaspoon cinnamon 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 227g warm milk 57g melted butter 1 large egg 170 grams cinnamon chips or 142g cinnamon sweet bits Cinnamon-Sugar Plus or cinnamon-sugar, for topping 
    
     Directions   In a large bowl, mix together the flour, sugar, yeast, cinnamon, salt, and baking powder.   In a separate bowl, whisk together the milk, butter, and egg.   Combine the wet and dry ingredients, beating until smooth.  Stir in the cinnamon chips or bits. Let the batter rest at room temperature for 1 hour, covered. Towards the end of the rest, preheat the oven to 350Â°F.  Spoon the batter into a greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan. Sprinkle the top with cinnamon-sugar.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until it tests done; a cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean.   Remove the bread from the oven, let it rest in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer it from the pan to a rack to cool completely.   Note: Don't slice the bread while it's hot! It'll slice much better when it's completely cool.

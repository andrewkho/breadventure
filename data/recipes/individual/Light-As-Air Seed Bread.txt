Light-As-Air Seed Bread
    
    This light-textured loaf with crunchy crust is perfect to serve with soup or stew. 
    
     Bread  241g King Arthur Organic Bread Flour 142g semolina 255g lukewarm water 1 tablespoon garlic oil or olive oil 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 18g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast  Topping  1 tablespoon Artisan Bread Topping or your favorite seed mixture 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the bread ingredients, mixing and kneading to make a smooth, slightly sticky dough.   Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set it aside to rise for 1 hour; it should just about double in bulk.   Lightly grease the bottom part of a long covered stoneware baker, about 14 1/2" x 5". Sprinkle it with cornmeal or semolina.   Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and form it into a smooth 13" log.   Place the log in the pan, brush the top with water, and sprinkle with Artisan Bread Topping or your favorite seeds.   Cover the pan with its lid, and let the dough rise for 45 to 60 minutes. Check it occasionally to see where it's at; when ready to bake, it should have started to fill the pan side to side, and crowned about 1" over the rim.   Just before putting the loaf into the oven, slash the top several times. Hold your knife at a 45° angle to the dough's surface, and slice quickly and decisively, about 1/2" deep.  Place the pan in a cold oven, and set the oven temperature to 425°F. Bake the bread for 30 minutes, remove the lid from the pan, and bake an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until the bread is golden brown and its interior temperature measures 190°F on an instant-read thermometer.  Remove the bread from the pan, and allow it to cool on a rack. Store any leftovers, wrapped in plastic, at room temperature.    Yield: about 12 servings.

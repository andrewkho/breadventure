Banana Bran Bread
    
    Banana breads are often one of the first recipes a beginning baker tries. They have so much going for them: they're reasonably healthy, they're fast, they're usually moist, and the softer your bananas, the better they are. Banana breads make good friends with add-ins, too, like coconut, chocolate chips, nuts, and bran.  This loaf is  baked in an 8 1/2" x 4" pan instead of a more typical 9 x 5" quickbread pan. Using the smaller pan gives a taller loaf.
    
       340g mashed, very ripe bananas (the riper the banana, the better the flavor), about 4 medium bananas 1 large egg 50g vegetable oil or canola oil 60g bran cereal (not bran flakes) 2 teaspoons vanilla extract grated rind of 1 orange, or 1/4 teaspoon orange oil 57g nonfat yogurt, plain or flavored 170g King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 99g sugar 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan.  In a large mixing bowl, beat together until smooth the banana, egg, vegetable oil, bran cereal, vanilla, orange peel or oil and yogurt. Set aside.  In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and sugar.  Quickly and gently fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, stirring only until everything is moistened.  Spoon the batter into the pan.  Bake the bread in a preheated 350°F oven for 50 minutes to 1 hour, or until the cake tester inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.  Remove the bread from the oven, and cool for 5 minutes on a rack.   Remove the bread from the pan, and cool completely before slicing.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  While not officially qualifying as low-fat (3g fat or less per serving), this bread is certainly a healthier version of the banana bread you might be used to preparing.

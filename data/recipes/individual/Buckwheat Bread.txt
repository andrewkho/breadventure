     Directions   Weigh your flour; you’ll find its weight by toggling to “ounces” at the top of the ingredient section above. Or measure it by gently spooning it into a cup, then sweeping off any excess.  Mix and knead all the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine set to the dough cycle — until a soft, smooth dough forms.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl, and allow to rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy and doubled in bulk.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface, and shape it into an 8" log.  Place the log in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan, cover, and allow to rise until it’s crested 1/2" to 1" over the rim of the pan, 60 to 90 minutes.  Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until the bread's crust is golden brown, and the interior of the finished loaf measures 190°F on a digital thermometer.  Remove the bread from the oven, allow it to cool in the pan on a rack for 5 minutes, then turn it out of the pan onto the rack to cool completely.  Store the bread, wrapped, for up to 5 days; or freeze for up to 1 month.

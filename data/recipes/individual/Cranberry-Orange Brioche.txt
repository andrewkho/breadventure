Cranberry-Orange Brioche
    
    This sweet, buttery loaf is light and airy, and studded with tangy cranberries. It's a perfect breakfast treat served warm, spread with melting butter. 
    
       170g lukewarm water 2 large eggs 113g butter 25g sugar 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 ½ teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon orange extract, optional, for added flavor 1 tablespoon grated orange rind (zest) 482g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 113g dried cranberries 43g candied orange peel 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead together all the dough ingredients, except the cranberries and orange peel, to make a soft, smooth dough. If kneading by hand, this will take awhile due to the amount of butter in the dough.    Add the cranberries and peel, and knead for another 4 or 5 minutes.   Allow the dough to rise, covered, for about 1 hour, or until it's quite puffy.   Divide the dough into 20 pieces (about 1 7/8 ounces each) to make mini brioche; or 12 pieces (about 3 ounces each) to make larger individual brioche in muffin cups; or 2 pieces (about 18 ½ ounces) for full-size brioche pans.   Roll the dough into balls, and place into brioche papers, pans, or greased muffin cups.   Cover and allow to rise until doubled and puffy, abut 1 hour.   Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.   Bake the brioche for 14 to 18 minutes (for small brioche); 18 to 20 minutes (for muffin-sized brioche); or 30 to 35 minutes, for two large brioche. If necessary, tent lightly with foil midway through, to prevent over-browning. The finished bread will be a deep golden brown.   Remove the brioche from the oven, and transfer to a rack to cool completely.   Yield: 20 mini brioche; 12 muffin-sized brioche; or 2 larger brioche.   
    
     Tips from our bakers  We highly recommend using a stand mixer or bread machine to knead this dough; it's quite difficult to do by hand, given the amount of butter and eggs in the dough.

       227g lukewarm water 1 tablespoon olive oil or garlic oil, plus additional for drizzling   2 teaspoons Pizza Dough Flavor, optional  1 teaspoon salt  2 teaspoons instant yeast  177g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 156g semolina 2 teaspoons pizza seasoning, optional, for topping  
    
     Directions   Lightly grease a 9" round pie pan or cake pan, and drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil in the bottom.   Combine all of the ingredients, and beat at medium speed with an electric mixer for 3 to 4 minutes; or mix in a bread machine set on the dough cycle for 10 minutes or so.   Cover and let rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until the dough is very puffy.   Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and shape it into a ball.   Place the ball into the greased and oiled pan, cover the pan, and let dough rise for 60 minutes, until it becomes puffy. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375Â°F.   Gently poke the dough all over with your index finger. Drizzle it lightly with olive or garlic oil.    Bake the bread till it's golden brown, 35 to 40 minutes. Remove it from the oven, sprinkle with the pizza seasoning or dried herbs of your choice, wait 5 minutes, then turn it out of the pan onto a rack. Serve warm or at room temperature.

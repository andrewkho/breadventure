Stuffing Buns
    
    The flavor of these sage-scented yeast buns will remind you of mildly herbed turkey stuffing. They manage to be simultaneously hearty, and soft. The heartiness comes from the Harvest Grains Blend, our proprietary mix of seeds and grains; the softness, from milk, potato, and oil. Serve these as a dinner roll; a sandwich roll (they make great turkey sandwiches); or cut them up to use as the base for your stuffing.
    
       284g lukewarm water 50g vegetable oil 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 113g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour, organic preferred 74g Harvest Grains Blend 2 1/2 teaspoons Bell's Seasoning or ground sage 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 11g sugar 46g potato flour or dry potato flakes 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 28g butter, melted, optional, for brushing on buns    
    
     Directions   Combine all the ingredients, and mix and knead them by hand, mixer, or bread machine until cohesive and fairly smooth (considering the seeds).  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 60 to 90 minutes, until it's noticeably puffy.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased surface, and divide it into 16 pieces.  Round each piece into a smooth ball. Place the shaped buns about 1" apart in a lightly greased 9" x 13" pan, two 9" round pans, 11" x 11" pan, or equivalent.  Cover the pan, and let the rolls rise for 1 hour, or until they're touching one another and starting to fill the pan. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350Â°F.  Bake the rolls for 30 to 35 minutes, until they're golden brown on top.  Remove them from the oven, and brush with melted butter, if desired; this will keep their crust soft.  Store in a plastic bag at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Substitute 1/4 cup (1 1/4 ounces, 35g) sunflower seeds and 1/4 cup (1 1/4 ounces, 35g) toasted sesame seeds for the Harvest Grains Blend, if desired.

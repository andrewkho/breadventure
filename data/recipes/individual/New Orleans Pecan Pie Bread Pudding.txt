New Orleans Pecan Pie Bread Pudding
    
    This sweet, creamy, nutty pudding was universally loved when we put it out for taste-testing.
    
       425 to 482g bread, 3/4" cubes, tough crust removed 1 jar Pecan Pie in a Jar 57g butter, melted 6 large eggs 170g half & half or cream 
    
     Directions   Butter a 2-quart baking dish.  Microwave Pecan Pie in a Jar for 1 minute; carefully remove it from the microwave.   In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the melted butter, eggs, and half & half or cream.   Whisk in the pecan mixture. Scoop off most of the pecans, and set them aside.    Add the bread cubes to the milk/egg, and mix lightly to combine.    Pour the mixture into the dish; it may mound slightly.    Spoon the pecans over the top of the pudding.    Let the mixture sit for an hour or so at room temperature, or overnight in the refrigerator, covered. Just before baking preheat the oven to 350Â°F.  Bake the pudding for 45 to 55 minutes, uncovered, until the top is browned and the middle springs back when lightly pressed.   Remove the pudding from the oven, and serve warm, topped with ice-cream or whipped cream. Or, as they do in New Orleans, with whiskey sauce!  Yield: 8 to 10 servings  
    
     Tips from our bakers  How big a loaf of bread do you need to make 11 to 12 cups of bread cubes? A 1 1/2-pound loaf, with its crusts removed, should be just about right.Don't have Pecan Pie in a Jar? I tried the recipe using my favorite Pecan Pie filling recipe, increasing the eggs to 6 to cover the 6 eggs in the original recipe and it works just beautifully!

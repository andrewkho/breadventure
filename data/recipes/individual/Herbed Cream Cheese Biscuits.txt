Herbed Cream Cheese Biscuits
    
    When it's finally warm enough in the morning to eat breakfast on the porch or deck, why not celebrate with something really special? A classic brunch dish is herbed biscuits with smoked salmon and scrambled eggs. Chives are one of the first plants to be ready in spring, with tender, green shoots and puffy pom-pom pink flowers for garnishing. Just the colors on the plate —  the green chives in the golden biscuits set next to the orange salmon, and bright yellow eggs — are wonderful.
    
       298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 11g baking powder 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper 7g chopped fresh chives or 4g dried chives 1 teaspoon dried thyme 113g grated sharp cheddar cheese 57g butter or 46g vegetable shortening, cold 170g milk 113g cream cheese 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 425°. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients, including the grated cheese, until everything is evenly distributed.  Using a pastry fork or blender, your fingers or an electric mixer, cut in the butter or shortening, and cream cheese. Mix until crumbly. Some larger chunks of cheese and butter can remain.   Pour in the milk while tossing with a fork. The dough should remain a bit crumbly, but hold together when squeezed. Add an additional 1 to 2 tablespoons of milk if needed.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and fold it over a few times.  Pat it into an 8" square, 3/4" thick.  Cut it into 2" squares, or use a 2" round cutter. Place the biscuits on the baking sheet.  Bake the biscuits for 16 to 18 minutes, until they're lightly browned.  Serve biscuits warm or at room temperature.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 2 days, or for up to a month in the freezer.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Substitute chive cream cheese or herbed cream cheese for the chives, thyme and cream cheese, if desired.

Gluten-Free Chocolate Chip Zucchini Bread
    
    This moist, dense bread, with its mild hint of cinnamon and assertive chocolate flavor thanks to the chips, is gluten-free — though you'd never know it from its flavor or texture. 
    
       3 large eggs 113g molasses or honey 99g vegetable oil 71g brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 312g King Arthur Gluten-Free Flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon xanthan gum 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 340g shredded, unpeeled zucchini (about 1 small/medium zucchini) 170g chocolate chips 85g chopped walnuts, optional 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F; lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.   In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, molasses or honey, oil, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.  Add the flour, salt, xanthan gum, baking soda, baking powder, and cinnamon, mixing until well combined.   Stir in the zucchini, chocolate chips, and nuts. Let the batter rest for 15 minutes, then stir to redistribute the chips and nuts.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan.  Bake the bread for 65 to 70 minutes, until the loaf tests done (a toothpick or cake tester inserted into the center will come out clean, save for perhaps a smear of chocolate).   Remove the bread from the oven, and let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes before turning it out of the pan onto a rack.   Cool completely before slicing; store well-wrapped, at room temperature.  Yield: one 9" x 5" loaf.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Since gluten-free batter is thinner than standard batter, the chips and nuts tend to sink to the bottom of the loaf; that's why it's important to let the batter rest and thicken for 15 to 20 minutes, then stir to redistribute the add-ins before pouring it into the pan and baking. Another technique you can try is leave the chips and nuts out of the batter initially, then stir them into the top third of the batter once it's been poured into the pan.

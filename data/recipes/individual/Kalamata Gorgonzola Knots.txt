Kalamata Gorgonzola Knots
    
    These rolls were a finalist in the National Festival of Breads biannual competition. Submitted by Elke Roby of Lincoln, Nebraska, these savory twists are both flavorful and beautiful. 
    
       85g coarsely chopped pitted Kalamata olives + 16 whole olives, for garnish 57g warm water 50g sugar 1 tablespoon instant yeast or active dry yeast 227g milk, at room temperature 2 large eggs 602g to 631g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour, divided 99g olive oil 1 teaspoon salt 50g basil pesto 59g Gorgonzola cheese, finely crumbled 
    
     Directions   For the dough: Rinse and drain the chopped olives.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the water, sugar, yeast, milk, eggs, and 2 cups of the flour. Let sit until bubbly (about 10 minutes).  Mix in the oil and salt. Add the remaining flour 1 cup at a time, mixing until a soft dough forms. Knead for 6 to 8 minutes, then cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.  To shape: Line two baking sheets with parchment. Deflate the dough and roll on a lightly floured work surface to a 24" x 16" rectangle with the long edge facing you. Spread the pesto on the lower half of the rectangle. Sprinkle the pesto-covered half with the chopped olives and Gorgonzola.    Fold the top half of the dough down over the filling. Lightly press down and pinch the edges to seal. Cut the dough into 16 strips, 1 1/2" wide by 8" long.  Taking one strip at a time, twist the ends away from each other two or three times. Tie into a loose knot. Place on the prepared baking sheet and tuck one whole olive in the center of each knot.  Cover with greased plastic wrap and let rise until doubled, about 40 minutes. Halfway through the rising time, preheat the oven to 375Â°F.   Uncover the rolls and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove from the oven and serve warm.

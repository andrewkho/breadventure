     Tips from our bakers  Try this starter in our Gluten-Free Sourdough Flatbread and our  Gluten-Free Sourdough English Muffins.  For a fun experiment, try substituting 1/2 cup starter for 1/2 cup of the flour and 2 ounces (1/4 cup) of the liquid in our gluten-free blueberry muffin recipe or any other muffin, cake or quick bread of your choice.For tangier yeast bread recipes, try using 1 cup starter in place of 1/2 cup water and 1 cup flour.Sourdough starter is best stored in the fridge in a stoneware crock or glass container with a loose-fitting lid. You should observe the same procedures for care and maintenance as for a wheat-based starter.

Soft Sandwich Rolls
    
    The following recipe will produce a tender, close-grained, hamburger-type roll, rich with milk and butter. Golden brown outside and cream-colored inside, with just a hint of sweetness, these rolls are the perfect vehicle for peanut butter and jelly, cheese, lunch meat, tuna salad, and just about any other kind of sandwich you can think of.  
    
       361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 1/2 teaspoons regular instant yeast or active dry yeast 25g sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 46g potato flour or dried potato flakes 71g lukewarm water 170g lukewarm milk 43g butter, softened or melted 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a smooth, supple dough.  Transfer the dough to a lightly oiled bowl; cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set the dough aside to rise until doubled in bulk, 1 1/2 to 3 hours, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.  Divide the dough into eight pieces. Shape each piece into a smooth ball, and flatten the balls until they're about 4" in diameter, trying to keep the tops of the rolls smooth; the nicer the top looks at this point, the nicer the roll will turn out to be once it's baked.  Drape the rolls with lightly greased plastic wrap, and set them aside to rise until they're very puffy, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the rolls for 20 to 22 minutes, or until they're golden brown.  Remove the rolls from the oven, set them on a rack to cool, and brush them with melted butter, if desired. This will give the rolls a soft crust.    When the rolls have cooled completely, store them in an airtight container for several days at room temperature. Freeze, well-wrapped, for longer storage.

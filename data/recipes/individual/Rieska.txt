Rieska
    
    Rieska, a native of Finland, features the texture of a cakey drop biscuit. A quick and easy baking powder bread, it's packed with whole grains and very tasty to boot. 
    
       35g old-fashioned rolled oats 113g pumpernickel flour (first choice), or any other rye flour 128g King Arthur all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 25g sugar 57g unsalted butter 340g buttermilk 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 500Â°F. This temperature isn't a misprint - this is a wet dough, and the high temperature works fine. Grease a 9" x 13" pan.   In a large bowl, whisk the oats and flours with the baking powder, baking soda, salt, and sugar.   Work the butter into the dry ingredients until thoroughly distributed. Stir in the buttermilk. (A dough whisk is the tool of choice here.) The mixture will be very sticky; that's OK.  Transfer the dough to the prepared baking sheet and, using wet hands, pat it out so it fills the pan.    Bake the bread for 15 to 17 minutes, until the top is light golden brown and springs back when gently touched. Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack before slicing.

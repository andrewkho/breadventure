Cranberry Cornmeal Bread/Stuffing
    
    Jewel-like pieces of fresh cranberry sparkle in this sunny yellow cornmeal yeast bread. Its sturdy texture stands up better in stuffing than would plain cornbread.
    
       454g boiling water 206g yellow cornmeal 170g honey 60g vegetable shortening 21g active dry yeast 113g lukewarm (110°F) water 2 teaspoons salt 602g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 149g cranberries, coarsely chopped 
    
     Directions   Combine the boiling water, cornmeal, honey and shortening. Cover the mixture and allow it to cool to 110°F, about 1 hour.   In a large bowl combine the yeast and lukewarm water. Stir to dissolve the yeast.   Add the salt, 2 cups flour, and cooled cornmeal mixture. Beat the batter vigorously for 2 minutes.  Add enough remaining flour, a little at a time, to make a workable dough.   Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead, adding more flour as necessary, until you have a smooth, elastic dough. Toward the end, knead in the cranberries.  Put the dough into an oiled bowl, turning once to make sure the entire ball is coated with oil. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise until puffy, about 1 hour.   Deflate the dough and turn it out onto the work surface. Grease two 10" x 5" bread pans.   Divide the dough in half and shape into two loaves. Place the loaves in prepared pans and let it rise until puffy, about 45 minutes.   Preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake the loaves for 30 minutes, or until the bread tests done.   Remove the cornbread from the pans, and cool them completely on a wire rack.  Store the loaves, well wrapped, for up to 5 days at room temperature or for up to a month in the freezer.

Dilled Onion Potato Rolls
    
    Soft and mildly flavored, potato-based doughs are quick to rise. Adding dill and onion to a neutral roll will bring some interest to the bread basket accompanying the meal.
    
       361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 11g instant yeast 25g sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 106g mashed potato 28g butter or margarine 113g milk 113g water 2 teaspoons dill seed or dried dill weed or a combination of the two 37g minced dried onion 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — and knead until a soft, smooth dough forms.   Set the dough aside to rest, covered, for 10 minutes.   To shape and bake the dough: Divide the dough into 16 pieces.  Shape each piece into a ball, and place the balls, evenly spaced, in two lightly greased 8" round cake pans.  Tent the pans with lightly greased plastic wrap and allow the rolls to rise until they've filled the pan, 45 minutes to 1 hour.   Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the rolls in a preheated 350°F oven for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove them from the pan, and brush them with melted butter or margarine, if desired.  Store, well-wrapped, for 3 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  If you prefer to use active dry yeast, be aware that rolls will need to rise about 1 1/2 hours instead of 45 minutes.

Dark Chocolate Bread Pudding
    
    Is there any comfort food as purely comforting as warm, soft, chocolate-y bread pudding? There's nothing like it on a cold winter's night (or on February 14!)
    
       276g bread cubes (See "tips," below.) 255g semisweet chocolate, chopped, or chocolate chips 198g sugar 43g cocoa, unsweetened baking cocoa or Dutch-process cocoa 680g milk or half & half 6 large eggs 1/2 teaspoon salt 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 
    
     Directions   Lightly butter the bottom and sides of a 2-quart baking dish, 9" x 13" pan, or equivalent.  Toss the bread cubes with 1 cup of the chopped semisweet chocolate, and place in the prepared pan.  Combine the remaining chopped chocolate with the sugar, cocoa, and 1 1/2 cups of the milk or half & half in a saucepan set over low heat.  Cook, stirring, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is thickened and smooth.  Transfer to a large bowl, and whisk in the remaining milk or half & half. Whisk in the eggs, salt, and vanilla.  Pour the mixture over the bread cubes and let rest for 30 minutes or so at room temperature, until the chocolate custard has been absorbed by the bread.    Preheat the oven to 325Â°F.  Bake the pudding for 45 to 50 minutes, until it's set. Remove from the oven and let cool for 10 minutes to allow the custard to fully set before serving.  Serve warm with whipped cream, ice cream, or dusted with confectioners' sugar.  Store, refrigerated, for up to 5 days.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  A 1-pound loaf of bread or brioche should yield about 6 1/2 cups bread cubes. Otherwise use 10 to 12 slices of bread, cut into 1/2" cubes.

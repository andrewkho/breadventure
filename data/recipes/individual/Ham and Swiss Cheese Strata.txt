Ham and Swiss Cheese Strata
    
    Stratas are a host's best friend. Easy to toss together the night before, you can vary the cheeses depending on your tastes and fridge contents (many New Englanders prefer Cheddar, but the options are endless). Virginia ham adds a smoky richness that can be balanced by a side of fruit.
    
       397g bread cubes 103g scallions, sliced 255g diced ham 227g shredded cheese 9 large eggs 1134g milk 3/4 teaspoon Worcestershire 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon pepper 
    
     Directions   Butter or oil a 9" x 13" baking pan.  In a large mixing bowl, combine the bread cubes, scallions, ham, and cheese. Stir everything to mix it evenly, and put the mixture into the prepared baking pan.  In a medium sized bowl, beat the eggs, milk and seasonings together.  Pour this mixture slowly over the bread cubes in the pan, being careful to wet the entire top.  Cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate it overnight.  The next morning, preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Let the strata warm on the counter while the oven heats.  Bake the strata for 60 to 70 minutes until the top is puffy and golden brown. The center may look slightly liquid, but will finish setting up after you take it out of the oven.  Serve the strata warm.  Refrigerate any leftovers, covered, for up to 3 days.

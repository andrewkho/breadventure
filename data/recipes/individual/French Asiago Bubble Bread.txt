     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a soft, smooth dough.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise until puffy, about an hour.   Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface. Cover it with a clean towel, and let it rest for 10 minutes.   To make the filling: Combine all of the filling ingredients in a small bowl. Set aside.   To assemble and bake: Lightly oil a 9" round cake pan.  Divide the dough into 14 pieces and shape each into a ball.   Dip each ball in the filling mixture, and lay them into the pan. Pour any remaining filling evenly over the dough.  Cover the pan with greased plastic wrap, and let the dough rise for 30 minutes.  While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 400°F.  Bake the bread for 20 to 25 minutes, or until it's golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and allow it to cool for 10 minutes before serving.  Store, well-wrapped, for 3 days at room temperature. Freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  A dark-colored pan will produce bread with a crispier bottom than a light-colored, reflective pan.

Dilled Peasant Rye Bread
    
    Though most people are more familiar with caraway-flavored rye breads, this one features the familiar flavor of dill. Served it with a soft cheese and pickled onions or vegetables, it makes a good change from the norm.
    
       2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 227g water 11g sugar 14g vegetable oil or butter 213g rye flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 tablespoon dill seeds or dill weed 85g to 120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 28g rye bread improver topping seeds of your choice:  sesame, poppy, sunflower 
    
     Directions   In a large bowl (or in a bread machine) combine the yeast, water, sugar, oil or butter, and rye flour, mixing until smooth. Cover and let rest for 45 minutes.  Add the salt, dill seeds or weed, 3/4 cup flour and Rye Bread Improver.  Knead the dough until smooth (adding additional flour if necessary), place it in a lightly greased bowl, cover it, and let it rise for 1 hour. (Or prepare the dough in your bread machine set on the Dough or Manual cycle.)   Shape the loaf into a slightly flattened round, set it on a sheet pan, and let it rise, covered, for 1 hour, or until it's almost doubled in bulk. Spray the loaf with water, and sprinkle with the seeds of your choice, if desired.    Bake the bread in a preheated 350°F oven for 40 to 45 minutes, or until it's golden brown and tests done; the center of the loaf should read 200°F on an instant-read thermometer.  Cool the loaf on a wire rack or, for an extra-crispy crust, allow it to cool in the turned-off oven with the door cracked open.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

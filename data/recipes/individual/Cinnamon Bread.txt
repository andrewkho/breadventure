Cinnamon Bread
    
    This soft white loaf features a lovely spiral of cinnamon-sugar inside. It makes a delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich. And, of course, it's ideal for cinnamon toast, and French toast.    Our guarantee: This tender, close-grained loaf rises to a lovely dome, and bakes up golden brown. The thin layer of cinnamon filling forms a pretty spiral inside.   From amaranth to teff, ancient grains offer a world of baking possibilities. Find out how to make this recipe using ancient grains in our complete guide to baking with ancient grains. 
    
     Dough  1/4-ounce packet "highly active" active dry yeast; or 2 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast; or 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 198 to 255g lukewarm water* 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 35g sugar 85g unsalted butter, at room temperature 18g nonfat dry milk 43g instant mashed potato flakes *Use the lesser amount in summer (or in a humid environment), the greater amount in winter (or in a dry climate), and somewhere in between the rest of the year, or if your house is climate controlled.  Filling  50g granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon 2 teaspoons King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 large egg beaten with 1 tablespoon water, to brush on dough 
    
     Directions   If you're using "highly active" or active dry yeast, dissolve it with a pinch of sugar in 2 tablespoons of the lukewarm water. Let the yeast and water sit at room temperature for 15 minutes, until the mixture has bubbled and expanded. If you're using instant yeast, you can skip this step.  Combine the dissolved yeast (or instant yeast) with the remainder of the ingredients. Mix and knead everything togetherby hand, mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycletill you've made a smooth dough. Adjust the dough's consistency with additional flour or water as needed; but remember, the more flour you add while you're kneading, the heavier and drier your final loaf will be. If you're kneading in a stand mixer, it should take about 7 minutes at second speed, and the dough should barely clean the sides of the bowl, perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom. In a bread machine (or by hand), it should form a smooth ball.   Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl. Cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise, at room temperature, until it's nearly doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Rising may take longer, especially if you've kneaded by hand. Give it enough time to become quite puffy.  While the dough is rising, make the filling by stirring together the sugar, cinnamon, and flour.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and pat it into a 6" x 20" rectangle.   Brush the dough with the egg/water mixture, and sprinkle it evenly with the filling.  Starting with a short end, roll the dough into a log.  Pinch the ends to seal, and pinch the long seam closed.  Transfer the log, seam-side down, to a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan. Tent the pan loosely with lightly greased plastic wrap.  Allow the bread to rise till it's crested about 1" over the rim of the pan, about 1 hour. Again, it may rise more slowly for you; let it rise till it's 1" over the rim of the pan, even if that takes longer than an hour. While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 40 to 45 minutes, tenting it lightly with aluminum foil after the first 15 minutes. The bread's crust will be golden brown, and the interior of the finished loaf should measure 190°F on an instant-read thermometer.   Remove the bread from the oven, and gently loosen the edges with a heatproof spatula or table knife. Turn it out of the pan, and brush the top surface with butter, if desired; this will give it a soft, satiny crust. Allow the bread to cool completely before slicing.   
    
     Tips from our bakers  When making yeast bread, let the dough rise to the point the recipe says it should, e.g., "Let the dough rise till it's doubled in bulk." Rising times are only a guide; there are so many variables in yeast baking that it's impossible to say that bread dough will ALWAYS double in bulk in a specific amount of time.Don't skip the step of brushing the dough with the egg/water wash before sprinkling on the filling. The egg is what keeps the bread from "gapping" around the filling.If you bake this bread in a 9" x 5" loaf pan, it'll be flatter and not as nicely domed. It will have risen to about even with the rim of the pan when it's ready to go into the oven.Interested in learning more about ancient grains — and how to use them?

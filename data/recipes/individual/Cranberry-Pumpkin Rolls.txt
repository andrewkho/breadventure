Cranberry-Pumpkin Rolls
    
    These deep-gold rolls will look lovely in your holiday breadbasket.
    
       567g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves (optional)  50g firmly packed brown sugar, light or dark 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 10g instant yeast 201g canned pumpkin or squash 2 large eggs 170g water 57g unsalted butter, softened 128g dried cranberries or golden raisins 46g diced crystallized ginger 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead all of the dough ingredients except the fruit and crystallized ginger — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until you've made a soft, fairly smooth dough. Pumpkin varies in water content, so add extra water or flour if needed. Right at the end, knead in the fruit and crystallized ginger.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow the dough to rise for 1 1/2 hours, until it's almost double in bulk.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface, gently deflate it, and divide it into 16 pieces, roughly 2 3/4 ounces each.  Roll each piece into a ball. Place rolls in the lightly greased cups of a couple of standard muffin pans (which will help them maintain their round shape); or onto a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.  Set aside, covered lightly, to rise for 1 hour, or until the rolls look puffy.   Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes, until they're lightly browned and the center of one reads 190°F on an instant-read thermometer.  Remove the pans from the oven and turn the rolls out onto a rack to cool. Serve warm or at room temperature.

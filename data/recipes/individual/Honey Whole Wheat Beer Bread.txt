Honey Whole Wheat Beer Bread
    
    For quick and easy whole wheat bread without the kneading, this batter bread is your answer. Enhanced with a touch of honey, butter, and crunchy, beer-soaked grains, it's a great bread, either plain or buttered, to enjoy alongside a bowl of soup or stew.
    
       113g six-grain blend 340g beer 283g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 1 tablespoon baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 71g melted butter, divided 85g honey 
    
     Directions   Combine the six-grain blend and beer in a large measuring cup and set aside to soak for 2 hours or longer.  Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add 4 tablespoons of the melted butter, the honey, and the beer-grain mixture, and stir until fairly smooth; some small lumps are okay.  Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top. Brush with the remaining tablespoon of melted butter.  Bake the bread for 50 to 55 minutes, until a toothpick inserted about 1/2" into the top of the loaf comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs clinging to it; a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf will register between 195°F and 200°F.  Remove the bread from the oven, and after 5 minutes turn it out onto a rack to cool.  Wait until the bread cools completely before slicing.   Store airtight at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.

White Chocolate-Cinnamon Bread
    
    Some of the white chips melt in this dough, contributing to the smooth texture of this bread, while other chips stay whole, giving you a potent burst of the flavor of white chocolate with each bite. 
    
       113g milk, lukewarm 113g water, lukewarm 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 25g sugar 2 teaspoons cinnamon 28g unsalted butter 361g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 227g white chocolate chips 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients, except the white chocolate, into the pan of your bread machine and program for the basic cycle, light crust (if possible).  Check the dough after 10 to 15 minutes of kneading; it should have formed a smooth ball, soft, but not sticky. If necessary, adjust the dough's consistency with additional water or flour.  Add the white chocolate when the machine signals, or about 3 minutes before the end of the kneading cycle.  When the kneading cycle stops, check and see if all the chips have been kneaded in; if not, take the dough out of the machine, and knead in any remaining chips by hand. Return the bread to the machine, and allow it to complete its cycle.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Chocolate breads, rich in fat and sugar, are never an exact science in the bread machine. If desired, use your machine's dough or manual cycle, adding the chips at the end of the second kneading cycle. Then, at the conclusion of the dough or manual cycle, remove the dough, shape it as you wish, let it rise until it's just about doubled in size, and bake it in a 350Â°F oven for about 35 minutes. Check the loaf after 20 minutes of baking, as its high sugar content will cause early browning.

Pain de Mie Grilled Bacon, Tomato, and Pimento Cheese
    
    When we made these meltingly delicious sandwiches in the test kitchen, they were devoured just about as quickly as they came off the panini press. One taster proclaimed that it was the best "toasted cheese" he'd ever eaten, while many others admitted to going weak at the knees upon their first bite. Thus, we can highly recommend these sandwiches for any crowd. Our bread of choice is Pain de Mie, which has a nice, tight crumb that toasts up beautifully, complementing perfectly its ooey-gooey cheese filling.
    
       227g mayonnaise 57g Vermont cheese powder 340g grated cheddar cheese, Cabot brand preferred 1 4-ounce jar diced pimiento, drained 18 slices Pain de Mie bread 2 medium tomatoes, thinly sliced 454 g bacon, cooked soft butter or mayonnaise, for spreading on sandwiches 
    
     Directions   Mix together the mayonnaise, cheese powder, grated cheese, and pimiento.  Spread an even, 1/8"-thick layer of the mayo/cheese mixture onto one side of each slice of bread â€” a jumbo cookie scoop is an easy way to measure the quantity of cheese you'll need for a typical slice.  Top nine slices of the cheese-slathered bread with slices of bacon and tomato. Place the remaining slices of bread, cheese side down, on top of the sandwich.   Spread a thin layer of butter or mayonnaise on both sides of the sandwich.  Cook the sandwiches until golden brown in a panini press, on a griddle, or in a frying pan set over medium heat. If you're cooking on a griddle or in a pan, you'll need to flip the sandwiches over in order to get both sides toasted).  Yield: 9 sandwiches.

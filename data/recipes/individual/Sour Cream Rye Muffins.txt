Sour Cream Rye Muffins
    
    If you love the rich flavor of rye bread — but balk at the long process involved in making a yeast loaf — you'll enjoy these tender, moist muffins. Serve as your bread offering alongside soup or a hearty stew. Also, they're reminiscent of rye toast, and thus pair delightfully with your breakfast eggs!
    
       120g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 103g rye flour, white, medium, or pumpernickel  2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 3/4 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon Deli Rye Flavor, optional, but delicious 1 teaspoon onion powder (powder, not onion salt), optional 7g mixed seeds: caraway, fennel, mustard, anise, or artisan bread topping, optional 28g brown sugar 78g French fried onions, or 28g minced dried onions 50g vegetable oil 227g sour cream or plain yogurt, full-fat or low-fat (not nonfat) 2 large eggs 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line a 12-well muffin pan with paper cups, and grease the cups.  In a mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.  In a measuring cup (or a separate bowl), whisk together the vegetable oil, sour cream or yogurt, and eggs.   Stir the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients just until blended. The batter will be quite thick.  Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups.  Bake the muffins for 25 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.   Remove the pan from the oven, and carefully tilt each muffin in its cup, to prevent the bottoms from steaming and becoming soggy.  Store the leftover muffins, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to a month.

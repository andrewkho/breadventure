Chimichurri Rolls
    
    You won't need to worry about transporting any sauce when the spicy Argentinian chimichurri flavor is baked right into the rolls. Try these savory rolls, loaded with garlic, onion, and parsley, with grilled hamburgers, sliced beef or smoked turkey. They pack a punch with the addition of cayenne; tone it down if you like less heat.
    
       227g water 2 teaspoons white wine vinegar 35g olive oil or garlic oil 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper 3/4 teaspoon oregano 2 teaspoons minced processed garlic OR 2 teaspoons minced, sautéed garlic (See "tips", below.) 18g canned "french-fried" onions, OR chopped, sautéed onions 2 tablespoons dried parsley 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 11g sugar 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast some cornmeal for baking 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine according to the manufacturer's recommendations.  Program for Dough or Manual, and press Start.  Check the dough's consistency about 7 minutes after the kneading cycle begins, adding additional water or flour to form a soft, smooth dough.  When the cycle is complete, remove the dough from the machine and divide it into 12 equal pieces.  Shape each piece into a ball, and place the balls 2" apart on a baking sheet lightly dusted with cornmeal.  Cover with a proof cover or greased plastic wrap, and let the rolls rise for 45 minutes, or until they're quite puffy.   Preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake the rolls for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown.  Remove them from the oven, and allow them to cool completely before serving.   Store, wrapped, at room temperature for up to 3 days, or in the freezer for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  It's important not to use raw garlic here. It needs to be either the kind you buy in a jar, or you need to saute fresh garlic. Raw garlic contains enzymes that inhibit yeast growth.

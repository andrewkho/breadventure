Maple Walnut Rolls
    
    This white and whole wheat bread is maple-sweet and nutty. It's delicious as is, or makes great French toast or bread pudding.
    
       227g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 120g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 7g King Arthur Whole-Grain Bread Improver, optional, but helpful 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 78g maple syrup 71g cinnamon chips 113g chopped walnuts 1/4 teaspoon natural maple flavor 35g Bakers' Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 28g butter 255g to 283g water 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Lightly grease a 12" x 12" sticky bun pan or two 9" round pans.  Divide the dough into 16 pieces, round each piece into a ball, and place the balls in the pan(s).  Allow the rolls to rise, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, or until puffy.    Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the rolls for 20 to 23 minutes.   Remove them from the oven, and let them cool completely on a wire rack.  Store the rolls, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to a month.

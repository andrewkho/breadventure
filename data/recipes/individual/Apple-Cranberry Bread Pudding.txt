       85g dried cranberries 85g chopped dried apples 170g boiled cider 113g water 907g milk (whole, low-fat, or nonfat) 5 large eggs 149g sugar 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 1 tablespoon grated orange rind or a few drops orange oil 213g crouton-size bread cubes, fresh or stale 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly grease an 8 1/2" x 11" or 9" x 9" pan, or a 2-quart baking dish.  Bring the cranberries, dried apples, boiled cider and water just to a boil in a microwave-safe bowl or sauce-pan. Remove from the heat, and set aside to cool.  Whisk together the milk, eggs, sugar, vanilla, salt, cinnamon, and grated rind.  Stir in the softened fruit and bread.  Let rest for about 15 minutes. (Note: You can prepare the pudding up to this point and refrigerate, covered, overnight; then bake the next day.)  Pour the pudding into the prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 60 minutes, until set and golden.  Remove from the oven, and let the pudding rest for 10 minutes before serving.  Serve with cinnamon whipped cream or ice cream, if desired.

Harvest Bread
    
    This honey-sweetened loaf gets its moist, light texture and golden color from mashed sweet potato, which also contributes the starch that helps keep the bread fresh. A typical potato bread, it's wonderful fresh, lovely for toast — and ideal for turkey sandwiches.We use SAF Gold instant yeast in this recipe, rather than regular instant yeast. The Gold yeast, formulated for sweet doughs, provides the steady, controlled rise helpful for breads high in sugar.

     Directions   To make this loaf in a bread machine: Place all of the ingredients except the raisins and nuts into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Basic, White Bread, or Raisin Bread, and press Start. Add the nuts and raisins when the machine prompts you, or about 3 to 4 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle.  To make this loaf without a bread machine: Mix and knead the dough — by hand or mixer — until a smooth, supple dough is formed.  Allow the dough to rise in a lightly greased bowl, covered, for 60 to 90 minutes, until well-risen and puffy.  Shape the loaf into a log and place it in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan. Allow the loaf to rise for 60 minutes until crowned 1" over the rim of the pan.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for 35 to 45 minutes, or until a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf registers about 190°F. Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out of the pan, and let it cool on a rack.  Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days on the counter, or for up to 3 months in the freezer.

PDQ* Onion Rye Bread
    
    *As in pretty darned quick. It's almost oxymoronic to think of rye bread, traditionally made with a starter and treated to a long, slow rise, as being quickly made. But you can mix up the baking powder leavened batter for this tender, moist bread in just a couple of minutes. A hot, delicious loaf will be on your table in less than an hour, start to finish. We love to serve this toasted and buttered, with eggs at breakfast or with stew or soup later in the day. It also makes a tasty open-faced Reuben or pastrami sandwich.
    
       294g rye flour blend 1/2 teaspoon Deli Rye Flavor 1 teaspoon salt 14g granulated sugar 1 teaspoon caraway seeds 57g canned "french fried" onions 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 39g vegetable oil 1 large egg 227g water 113g sour cream artisan bread topping, for sprinkling on top 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F and grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.   In a medium-sized bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients.   In another medium-sized bowl, whisk together the oil, egg, water and sour cream, then stir the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients, mixing just until blended. The mixture will look a bit lumpy; that's OK.   Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake the bread for 50 to 55 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean.   Remove the bread from the oven, wait 5 minutes, then turn it out of the pan and cool it on a wire rack.   Store, well-wrapped, for 4 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to a month.

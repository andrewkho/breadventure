Walnut-Strawberry (or Rhubarb) Quick Bread
    
    Everyone loves this bread no matter which way we make it: all strawberry, all rhubarb, or a combination of the two. This recipe also works well using other fruit purées, such as applesauce or plum.
    
       57g chopped walnuts 177g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 198g sugar 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 1 tablespoon lemon zest or 1/4 teaspoon lemon oil 2 large eggs 283g mashed strawberries (See "tips", below) 110g vegetable oil 
    
     Directions   Preheat your oven to 350°F. Grease and flour (or spray with non-stick vegetable oil spray) a 9" x 5" loaf pan.   In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the walnuts, flour, sugar, soda, salt and nutmeg. In a separate bowl, whisk together the lemon, eggs, strawberries and vegetable oil.  Combine the wet ingredients with the dry ingredients, whisking until well-blended.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan, and bake for 55 to 60 minutes, until a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Cool the bread in the pan for 15 minutes, then remove it from the pan and transfer it to a rack to cool completely, 1 hour or longer.  Store, well-wrapped, on the counter for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Use 1 1/4 cups cooked rhubarb in place of the strawberries, to make a slightly tart bread. Start with 2 1/2 cups sliced rhubarb. Cook over medium heat (or in the microwave) to make about 1 1/4 cups unsweetened rhubarb sauce. You may also substitute rhubarb for just some of the strawberries, to make strawberry-rhubarb bread.For best flavor and easiest slicing, wrap the bread while still slightly warm and let it sit overnight.

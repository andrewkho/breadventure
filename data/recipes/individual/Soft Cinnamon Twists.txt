     Dough  85g butter 227g water, warm 447g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 35g Bakers' Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 11g instant yeast 67g sugar 1 teaspoon nutmeg 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon Fiori di Sicilia OR 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 1 large egg  Filling  74g Baker's Cinnamon Filling 28g water  Cinnamon Glaze  57g butter, melted 99g Baker's Special Sugar or 99g granulated sugar, mixed with 4g cinnamon 
    
     Directions   To make the dough: Combine all of the dough ingredients and mix and knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes, until it's shiny and smooth.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. It should have almost doubled.  To make the filling: Mix the cinnamon filling with the water.  To shape and bake the twists: Lightly grease (or line with parchment) a baking sheet. On a lightly oiled surface, roll the dough into a 12" x 20" rectangle.   Spread the filling mixture evenly over half of the dough.  Fold the plain dough in half over the filling, and press and roll gently to seal.  Cut the dough into fifteen 3/4" strips, each about 12" long.  Gently twist the strips (like you were wringing out a towel), and place them on the baking sheet.  Let them rise, covered, for 30 to 45 minutes.  While they're rising, preheat the oven to 375Â°F.  Lightly spritz them with water, and bake the twists for 12 to 14 minutes.  Remove the twists from the oven when they're lightly browned, brush them with the melted butter, and sprinkle with the cinnamon mixture.  Store the twists in an airtight container for up to 3 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to a month.

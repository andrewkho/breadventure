       206g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 82g pumpernickel flour 18g rye bread improver or potato flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 1/4 teaspoons Deli Rye Flavor, optional 11g vegetable oil or 14g softened butter 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 227g lukewarm water 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients and mix and knead them — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until you have a soft, fairly smooth dough. Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 to 2 hours, or until it's noticeably puffy.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface. Divide dough into six balls, and place in a lightly greased hamburger bun pan, or on a parchment-lined baking sheet, flattening slightly. Center the kaiser roll cutter over each ball, and press down firmly, cutting to the bottom but not all the way through the dough.  Turn the rolls over so they're cut-side down; this helps them retain their shape. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until they've almost doubled in volume.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Turn the rolls cut-side up, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool on a rack.  Store, well-wrapped, for up to 3 days on the counter, or for up to a month in the freezer.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Note that the simplest way to give these rolls their traditional shape is with a kaiser roll stamp.

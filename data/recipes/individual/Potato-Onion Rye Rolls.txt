       298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 159g pumpernickel flour 34g potato flour or dried potato flakes 7g King Arthur Whole-Grain Bread Improver or 7g vital wheat gluten 25g vegetable oil 43g molasses 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons Deli Rye Flavor, optional but delicious 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 teaspoon caramel color, optional, an excellent color enhancer 283g to 340g lukewarm water 60g canned French-fried onions 2 tablespoons butter, melted, for brushing on the rolls 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead all of the ingredients (except the onions), by hand, mixer, or bread machine, until you've made a slightly sticky, shiny dough.  Knead in the onions, place the dough into a greased bowl, cover, and let rise in a warm spot for 1 to 2 hours, until it's grown by at least one-third.   Transfer the dough to a lightly greased or floured work surface and divide into 12 pieces.  Roll each piece into a ball and place in a greased 9" x 13" or 12" x 12" pan.  Cover the rolls and let rise 1 hour, until puffy looking. Preheat the oven to 425°F while they are rising.   Reduce the oven heat to 350°F, place the rolls in the oven, and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, until golden brown.  Remove the rolls from the oven, brush with melted butter, and serve warm.  Store the cooled rolls in an airtight container for 5 days or well-wrapped in the freezer for up to a month.

       283g lukewarm water 25g olive oil 361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 18g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 43g potato flour or 28g dried potato flakes 2 tablespoons herbes de Provence 1 teaspoon salt 1 ½ teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, and mix and knead  — by hand, mixer, or bread machine set on the dough cycle  — until smooth, adding additional water or flour as needed.   Cover the dough, and let it rise for 1 hour.   Divide the dough into 4 pieces, shape into logs, and place in lightly greased mini loaf pans. For one large loaf, shape the entire piece of dough into a log and place in a lightly greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.   Cover and let rise until the dough has crowned about ½" over the rims of the mini loaf pans, or 1" over the rim of the larger pan, 30 minutes to 1 hour, depending on the warmth of the kitchen. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.   Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes for the mini loaves, 35 to 40 minutes for the larger loaf. An instant-read thermometer, inserted into the center of a loaf, should register at least 190°F. Tent the bread lightly with foil if it appears to be browning too quickly.   Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out of the pan, and cool on a rack.   Yield: 4 mini loaves, or 1 large loaf.

Pottbrau
    
    This is a traditional Icelandic rye flatbread, Iceland's version of "the wrap." You often find it on the breakfast table to be eaten with smoked lamb or other cured, sliced meat and cheese. It's wonderful with gravlax, smoked salmon, herring or smoked mackerel. For best flavor, it's preferably cooked quickly on a grill.
    
       255g buttermilk 1/2 teaspoon salt 120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 159g pumpernickel 1 teaspoon baking powder 
    
     Directions   In a small mixing bowl, combine the buttermilk and salt.  Whisk together the remaining dry ingredients, and stir them into the buttermilk.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface, and knead it  until the dough is just developed, about 5 minutes.  Divide the dough into eight pieces, each approximately 2 1/2 ounces.  On a lightly floured surface, roll each piece into a circle about 8" in diameter.  If you have access to a grill, cook the circles quickly on both sides, allowing them to get quite dark so you have a hint of the fire in the flavor.  If you don't have a grill, or just want to make life easier, bake them quickly in a hot frying pan until there are dark brown spots covering the surface.  If you're baking them in a very hot oven (450Â°F), you'll discover that they'll become rye pitas, as they'll blow up like little balloons.  Upon cooling, keep the pottbrau covered (deflate them if you've chosen the oven route), as they're meant to be soft and pliable.  Store for two days at room temperature, or freeze for up a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  If you have time to cover the dough and let it rest for a couple of hours (or overnight in the refrigerator) before grilling or baking, the flavor and texture will be improved.

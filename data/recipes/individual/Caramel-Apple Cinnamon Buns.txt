Caramel-Apple Cinnamon Buns
    
    This recipe is a great new twist on cinnamon buns. The apple and caramel mirror the flavors found in one of our favorite autumn treats, caramel apples. These buns are best served warm; so if you have to wait awhile before sharing, gently reheat in the oven for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.
    
     Dough  369g Pastry Flour Blend or 390g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 43g potato flour or dried potato flakes 35g sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 43g butter 1 teaspoon Buttery Sweet Dough Flavor or vanilla extract 1 large egg 227g lukewarm milk  Filling  99g sugar 21g Instant ClearJel or King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 227g peeled, grated apple (1 to 2 large apples) 14g lemon juice 113g chopped walnuts, optional    142g caramel sauce (see tip, below) 
    
     Directions   To make the dough: Mix and knead all the ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to make a smooth, slightly sticky dough.   Cover the dough, and let it rest for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until doubled in bulk.  To make the filling: Combine the sugar, ClearJel, and cinnamon.   Toss the apples with the lemon juice; combine them with the sugar mixture.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface. Roll it into a 12" x 24" rectangle.   Spread with the filling, and top with walnuts.   Starting with a long side, roll the dough into a log and seal the edge.   Cut 12 equal slices; place them cut-side up in standard muffin cups lined with lightly greased baking papers.   Cover the buns and let them rise until puffy, 60 to 90 minutes. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the buns for 20 to 25 minutes, until lightly browned.   Remove the buns from the oven. Cool for 10 minutes, then drizzle with caramel sauce.  Yield: 12 buns.

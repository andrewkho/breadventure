Irish Common Brown Bread
    
    This recipe was developed by Robyn Brown Sargent, one of our baker education specialists. She notes that we should expect a sticky dough with this brown bread — but fear not, the bread machine handles this kind of dough well. Also, expect the finished loaf to have a flat top, or even sink a bit in the center.
    
     One (2-pound) Loaf  454g water 28g molasses or black treacle 2 teaspoons salt 418g King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour 85g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Program the machine for Dough or Manual, and press Start.  Check the dough's consistency about 7 minutes after the kneading cycle begins, adding additional water or flour to form a sticky dough.  Allow the machine to complete its cycle. Remove the dough.   Turn the sticky dough into a greased 9" x 5" loaf pan. Cover with greased plastic wrap and let it rise for 20 to 30 minutes, until it nearly reaches the top of the pan.  Preheat the oven to 450°F.  Bake the bread for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 425°F and bake for an additional 35 minutes; the interior temperature of the finished loaf as measured on an instant-read thermometer should be about 190°F.  Turn the bread out of the pan, and cool it on a rack before slicing.  Store at room temperature for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

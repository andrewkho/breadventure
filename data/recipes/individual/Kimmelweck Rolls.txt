Kimmelweck Rolls
    
    Before Buffalo chicken wings there was Beef on Weck, a great upstate New York tradition involving rare, hot, juicy roast beef on a salt- and caraway-encrusted hard roll. Here's the recipe for the rolls; the hot roast beef is up to you.
    
     Dough  170g water 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons sugar 1 teaspoon salt 163g High-Gluten Flour 163g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 18g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 25g potato flour 28g unsalted butter, softened 1 large egg  Topping  Equal parts (1 tablespoon each) caraway seeds, coarse salt and pumpernickel flour, mixed until well-combined 
    
     Directions   In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients except the topping, mixing to form a shaggy dough.  Knead the dough, by hand or by machine, for 10 minutes. Allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead for an additional 10 minutes, until it's smooth and supple.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour; it'll become quite puffy, though it may not double in bulk. You may also use your bread machine, set on the Dough cycle, to prepare the dough to this point.  Divide the dough into six 3 1/4-ounce (92g) pieces, and shape them into smooth, slightly flattened rounds. Place them on a baking sheet, covered, to rise for 1 hour, or until they're good and puffy.  While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 425Â°F.  Brush the rolls with a bit of melted butter, and sprinkle lightly with the topping. Bake them for 15 to 18 minutes, or until they're golden brown.  Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack; they're best served the same day they're made, though they do reheat nicely. Freeze for up to 1 month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Use more or less topping, according to your taste tolerance for salt.

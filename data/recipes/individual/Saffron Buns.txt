Saffron Buns
    
    Tender and lightly sweetened, luminous as gold, these saffron buns are a wonderful breakfast treat, spread with sweet butter.
    
     Buns  57g hot water 1/4 teaspoon crushed saffron threads 113g whole milk 64g sugar 28g butter, softened 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 large egg 18g instant yeast (SAF Gold instant yeast preferred)  361g to 390g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour  Topping  1 egg white beaten lightly with a teaspoon of water pearl sugar or other coarse sugar 
    
     Directions   Combine the hot water and saffron, and let sit for 10 minutes to soften the saffron.  In a mixing bowl, beat together the saffron water, milk, sugar, butter, salt, egg, yeast, and 2 cups of the flour.  Add enough of the remaining flour to make a soft dough.  Knead the dough (about 15 minutes by hand, 8 minutes in an electric mixer, 90 seconds in a food processor, or in your bread machine using the dough cycle).  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and set it aside to rise until puffy (but not necessarily doubled in bulk), about 2 hours.  Gently deflate the dough, and let it rest, covered, for 10 minutes.  Lightly grease a 12" deep-dish pizza pan or 9" x 13" pan.  Divide the dough into 16 pieces, and shape each piece into a ball.  Place the balls fairly close together (but not touching) in your pan, cover the pan, and let them rise until they're puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.  While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 375Â°F.  Glaze the buns with the beaten egg white, and sprinkle them heavily with pearl sugar.  Bake the buns for 20 minutes, or until they're golden brown. (Watch them closely at the end; because of their high sugar content, they tend to brown quickly.)  Serve with butter or  Devon cream.

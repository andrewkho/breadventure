     Directions   To make the dough: Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough. Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 45 minutes.  To make the filling: Pour the boiling water over the sun-dried tomatoes, and allow to sit for 10 minutes to soften.  Drain the tomatoes, and chop them into small pieces.  Add the tomatoes to the remaining filling ingredients, and stir until combined. Set aside.  To make the stromboli: Roll the dough into a 12" x 18" rectangle.   Crumble the filling mixture onto the dough, brush the edges with water or lightly beaten egg white, and roll the dough into an 18" log.   Place the log on a lightly greased baking sheet, cover, and set in a warm place to rise for 1 1/2 to 2 hours; the dough should look puffy, though not doubled.  While the stromboli is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Slash the dough crosswise, about 1/2" deep, at 3" to 4" intervals along its length.   Bake the stromboli for 35 to 40 minutes, until it's golden brown, tenting it lightly with foil if it appears to be browning too quickly.   Remove it from the oven, and allow it to cool for 20 minutes before serving. Serve warm, or at room temperature.   Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days in the fridge, or freeze for up to a month.

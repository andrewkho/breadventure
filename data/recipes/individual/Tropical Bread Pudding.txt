Tropical Bread Pudding
    
    If you bake a lot of bread, you're sure to have some that's starting to go stale (or has already gotten there). Bread pudding is a great use for leftover bread; this version brings a whiff of the tropics to the table.
    
       5 large eggs 907g milk: skim, 1%, 2% or whole 106g dried pineapple, finely diced 57g unsweetened shredded coconut, plus 28g for topping 2 teaspoons vanilla extract 28g rum, optional 149g to 198g sugar (use the larger amount for a sweeter pudding) 1/4 teaspoon salt 213g to 284g bread cubes, about 3/4" dice 
    
     Directions   Preheat your oven to 300Â°F. Butter a shallow 2-quart casserole dish.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs with the milk, pineapple, 1/2 cup coconut, vanilla, rum, sugar and salt.  Mix in the bread cubes.  Spoon the mixture into the buttered casserole dish, and top with the remaining 1/4 cup coconut.  Bake the bread pudding for 1 hour. The middle will feel set but still soft.  Store, covered, for up to 5 days in the fridge.

Tuscan-Style Bread with Herbs
    
    This large, rustic loaf can be sliced for sandwiches, or cut into chunks to serve with pasta. Any leftovers can be cubed and toasted into croutons — win-win-WIN!   
    
       2 teaspoons instant yeast  2 teaspoons Pizza Seasoning (or 1/2 teaspoon each dried oregano, basil, marjoram, and thyme)  1 1/2 teaspoons salt   340g lukewarm water 482g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, and mix and knead to make a smooth, very soft dough.   Put the dough in a greased bowl or other container, cover, and let it rise at room temperature for about 1 hour, or until it's puffy though not necessarily doubled.   After the first rise, deflate the dough, form into a round or a long loaf, and place on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet; or on a piece of parchment, if you're going to bake on a pizza stone.     Cover the loaf with greased plastic wrap, and let it rise for 30 to 45 minutes, until noticeably puffy.  While the loaf is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F. If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.    When the bread is almost doubled, remove the plastic, slash the top in a decorative pattern,     and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the center measures 190°F when measured with a digital thermometer.    Remove from the oven and cool for 30 minutes before slicing.    
    
     Tips from our bakers  In Tuscany, bread is traditionally served with salty partners like olives, Pecorino Romano and Parmesan cheeses, or salt-cured meats like prosciutto. While Tuscan bread is traditionally made without salt, we find that saltless bread tends to taste flat to most Americans; thus we add salt here. As a result of reader feedback, as of 7/10/17 we've increased the flour in this recipe from 3 1/4 cups to 4 cups (17 ounces). The greater amount of flour makes the dough easier to handle, without noticeably affecting the bread's light texture.

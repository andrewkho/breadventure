Skillet Cornbread
    
    This is Southern food writer Sheri Castle's take on a traditional Southern cornbread: skillet-born, sugar-free, and bacon-blessed. Some of her fellow natives of the Mountain South will scowl about using flour in the recipe, but she adds a little to ensure the cornbread will hold together using coarse, whole-grain meal. Be sure to use fresh liquid buttermilk; it's integral to the recipe and the flavor. 
    
       50g bacon drippings 245g coarse stone-ground cornmeal 57g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1/2 teaspoon baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 1 large egg 340g buttermilk, well shaken 
    
     Directions   Put the bacon drippings in a 9" cast iron skillet and place in the oven as it preheats to 450Â°F.   Whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl.   In a small bowl, whisk together the egg and buttermilk. Make a well in the center of the cornmeal mixture and pour in the egg mixture. Stir only until blended.   Remove the skillet from the oven and pour in the batter. It will sizzle and pop, so be careful.   Bake until the cornbread is firm in the middle and golden brown on top, about 25 minutes. Turn out onto a cutting board or cooling rack and serve piping hot.

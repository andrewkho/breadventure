Pepperoni Pizza Sticks
    
    These soft and chewy breadsticks are studded with spicy pepperoni.
    
       227g water 2 cups dried red & green bell peppers soaked in 1/4-cup water (optional) One box of Pizza Crust Mix Yeast packet (included with mix) 25g olive oil or garlic oil 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 78g diced pepperoni 4 teaspoons Pizza Dough Flavor  99g  freshly shredded Parmesan or Asiago cheese or an Italian mixture (mozzarella, Parmesan and provolone) 
    
     Directions   Mix together all the ingredients except the cheese — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until the dough is soft and supple.  Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.  Line with parchment paper, or lightly grease a baking sheet.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll it into a 12" square. Cut into 1/2" to 3/4" wide strips.  Place the strips on the baking sheet, and let them rise for 30 minutes.   While the strips are rising, preheat the oven to 425°F.  Bake the pizza sticks for 8 minutes.  Remove them from the oven, sprinkle with the cheese, and return them to the oven to bake for an additional 5 to 8 minutes, until they're golden brown and the cheese is melted.  Store, wrapped, for 2 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to a month.

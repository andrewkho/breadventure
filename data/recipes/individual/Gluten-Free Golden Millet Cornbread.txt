     Directions   Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease a 9" square pan.  Whisk together the millet flour, cornmeal, gluten-free flour, xanthan gum, Cake Enhancer, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.  Whisk together the melted butter or oil, sugar, buttermilk, and eggs.  Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk until smooth.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan then let it rest for 10 minutes.  Bake the cornbread for 25 to 30 minutes, until it's golden brown. It's fully baked once the internal temperature is 190°F, about 3 to 4 minutes beyond the point when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.  Remove the cornbread from the oven, allow it to cool for at least 5 minutes, and serve warm.

Honey Wheat English Muffins
    
    These whole grain, fiber-filled, slightly sweet muffins make a great base for everything from melting butter to eggs Benedict.  Note: you must have muffin rings (3 1/2" to 4") to make these English muffins.
    
       340g warm water 1 large egg, lightly beaten 64g honey 28g butter 14g non-diastatic malt powder 227g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 85g malted wheat flakes 96g Hi-maize Fiber 28g Baker's Special Dry Milk 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten  2 teaspoons instant yeast  2 teaspoons baking powder 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 to 2 tablespoons cornmeal or semolina to dust the griddle 
    
     Directions   Stir together all of the ingredients except the cornmeal or semolina.  Beat until the dough is glossy, about 6 to 8 minutes.    Cover the bowl, and let dough rise at warm room temperature until doubled in size, about 90 minutes.    Preheat both the oven and a griddle or heavy skillet to 350°F (medium high heat).  Grease metal muffin rings.    Place rings on the griddle, and sprinkle a little cornmeal or semolina into each; this will give muffins their traditional crust.   Scoop 1/3 cup of dough into each ring and spread the dough to the edge of the ring. (wet your fingers to stop the dough from sticking to them). Sprinkle with more semolina.  Cook the muffins for 5 to 6 minutes, until the edges look set and the bottom is golden brown. Flip the muffins, and cook the second side for 5 to 6 minutes.  Place the muffins on a baking sheet and place into a 350°F oven for 5 minutes.   Remove from the oven, cool for 5 minutes, and remove the rings (if they haven't already fallen off). Cool the muffins on a rack, and store at room temperature, well wrapped.  Yield: 12 English muffins.

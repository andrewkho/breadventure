10-Grain Orange Bread
    
    Whole grains can be earthy and filling, but this bread contains a slight sweetness and hint of orange that lightens the flavors. It marries well with turkey, particularly if you're one of the people who loves turkey sandwiches with a dollop of cranberry sauce in the filling.
    
       454g water 245g six-grain blend 11g active dry yeast or 2 teaspoons instant yeast 14g salt 50g oil 2 large eggs, beaten 1 tablespoon grated orange rind (or up to 1/2 teaspoon orange oil) 170g honey or 106g brown sugar 723g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 
    
     Directions   Bring 1 1/2 cups water to a boil, add the cereal, cover and let sit until the temperature reaches 110°F, about 1 hour.  Heat the remaining 1/2 cup water to 110°F and combine it with the yeast, in a large bowl, to soften.  Add the cereal mixture, salt, oil, eggs, orange rind (or oil), honey, and 2 cups of flour. Beat vigorously for two minutes. Gradually add enough remaining flour, a little at a time, to make a dough stiff enough to knead.  Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead, adding flour as necessary, until you have a smooth, elastic dough.  Put dough into an oiled bowl, turning once to make sure the entire ball is coated with oil. Cover with a towel, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.  Grease two 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" or three 8" x 3" pans.  Turn the dough out onto a work surface. Divide the dough into halves or thirds, depending on the pans you chose. Shape dough and place in the pans.   Cover with a lightly greased plastic wrap or a dough-rising cover and let rise until puffy, about 45 minutes.  Preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, or until they test done. Immediately remove bread from pans, and cool completely on a wire rack.  Store, well-wrapped, for up to a week, or freeze for up to 3 months.

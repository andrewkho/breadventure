       326g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 46g cornmeal or 54g semolina 2 teaspoons instant yeast or 1 packet active dry yeast dissolved in 1 tablespoon warm water 35g sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 57g butter 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 21g potato flour or dried potato flakes 227g water 28g butter, melted, optional 
    
     Directions   Using your hands, an electric mixer, a food processor or bread machine, mix and knead together all of the ingredients to form a smooth, soft dough.  Allow the dough to rise at room temperature, in a covered bowl, for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until it's puffy but not doubled in bulk.  Lightly grease or line a 12" round pan, two 8" or 9" cake pans, or a sheet tray.  Divide the dough into 24 pieces, about 1 1/8 ounces or 32g each. Shape each into a taut roll, and place on the tray. Cover with lightly greased plastic and allow to rise about an hour, until the dough is puffy.  While the rolls are rising, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the rolls for about 22 to 24 minutes, or until they're golden brown.  Remove them from the oven, and brush the tops with melted butter, if desired; this will give them a soft crust.  Wrap well and store for 3 days on the counter. Freeze for up to 3 months.

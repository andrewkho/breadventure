Rustic Olive Sourdough Bread
    
    This loaf's slight tang of sourdough, plus the brininess of olives, are perfectly complementary. The strength of these flavors works well with assertive sandwich fillings such as tuna, smoked fish, or meat. Which is not to say the bread isn't equally good slathered with salted butter, as a side to a Mediterranean-inspired meal.
    
       227g sourdough starter, ripe (fed) or discard   283g lukewarm water 50g olive oil 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 tablespoon sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 1 tablespoon fresh oregano, finely chopped; or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried oregano 539 to 574g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 71 to 142g drained, pitted, and coarsely chopped kalamata olives 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, except the olives, mixing and kneading to form a smooth dough then fold in the olives.  Cover the dough, and allow it to rise until it's doubled in size, about 90 minutes.  Gently divide the dough in half; it'll deflate somewhat.  Shape each piece of dough into a round loaf. Place each loaf on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.  Cover the loaves and let them rise until very puffy, about 1 hour. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 425Â°F.  Spray the loaves with lukewarm water, and make two fairly deep diagonal slashes in each.  Bake the loaves for 25 to 30 minutes, until they're a very deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool on a rack.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  For robust olive flavor, add 1 cup sliced olives, with 4 to 6 tablespoons additional flour, to the dough.For a crunchier crust, bake the loaves on a preheated pizza stone.

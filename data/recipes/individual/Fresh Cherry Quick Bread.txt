Fresh Cherry Quick Bread
    
    Using fresh cherries (or plums), this simple bread is quick to put together — and totally delicious.   
    
       113g butter, softened 149g granulated sugar 2 large eggs, beaten 14g vanilla extract 206g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons ground coriander or ground cardamom  1/2 teaspoon salt 11g baking powder 227g fresh cherries, pitted; or diced fresh plums 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.   Beat the butter and sugar together, then beat in the eggs and extract.   Sift the dry ingredients together and add to the wet ingredients. Stir in the cherries. Spoon the batter into the prepared pan.   Bake the bread for 45 to 55 minutes. Insert a skewer or cake tester into the center; it will come out clean when the bread is done.  Cool the loaf for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn it out on a rack to fully cool. Wrap in plastic until ready to serve; store it overnight for best flavor.   Store at room temperature for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  This recipe uses coriander, the seed of the cilantro plant. It has a mysterious and exotic taste — try it added to your coffee grounds in the morning. Add a tablespoon for a pot of eight cups, and brew as usual.

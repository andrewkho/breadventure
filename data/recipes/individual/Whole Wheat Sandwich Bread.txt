       340g lukewarm water* 28g butter or 25g vegetable oil 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 25g sugar 71g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 298g King Arthur 100% Organic White Whole Wheat Flour or Whole Wheat Flour 128g Hi-maize Fiber; or substitute whole wheat flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast *See "tips," below. 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, and mix and knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until you've made a smooth, fairly stiff (but not dry) dough.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover the bowl, and allow it to rise for 60 to 90 minutes, until it's expanded a bit. It won't have doubled in size, but should feel puffy when you squeeze it.  Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Gently shape the dough into a smooth log; there's no need to punch it down, just stretch and round it to fit into the pan.  Place it in the pan, smooth side up, cover the pan, and allow the loaf to rise for about 30 to 45 minutes, until it crowns over the rim of the pan by an inch or so.  Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until the center registers 190°F on a digital thermometer.  Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out of the pan onto a rack. Allow it to cool completely before slicing.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Reduce the water by 2 tablespoons if you're baking this bread in the summer, or when the weather's humid.

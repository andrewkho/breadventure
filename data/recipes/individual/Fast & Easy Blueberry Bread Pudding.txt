Fast & Easy Blueberry Bread Pudding
    
    Looking for instant gratification? This single-serve bread pudding "bakes" in the microwave in under 5 minutes.
    
       35g sandwich (or other non-crusty) bread 28g fresh or frozen blueberries 1 teaspoon soft butter 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon-sugar 1 large egg 67g milk or half & half 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract 18 to 25g sugar; use the greater amount of sugar if your berries are tart 
    
     Directions   Spread the bread with the butter, and sprinkle with cinnamon-sugar. Cut it into 1/2" cubes.  Layer the buttered bread with the berries in a microwave-safe bowl.  Whisk together the egg, milk, vanilla, and sugar. Pour over the bread and berries in the bowl, stirring gently to combine.  Microwave for 2 minutes, uncovered. Check and see if it's still liquid. If it is, microwave in 30-second bursts, till pudding is cooked all the way to the center; the very center can still look a bit uncooked, but it shouldn't be liquid.  Remove from the microwave. Garnish with fresh berries, if desired. Serve warm; whipped cream or ice cream are always welcome.  Yield: 1 large or 2 smaller servings.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  If you have time, pour the milk/egg over the bread and let it rest 10 to 15 minutes before microwaving. this will make a softer, "creamier" pudding.  When you cook the berries in the pudding, they release their juice. Some testers liked this; some thought it looked messy. If you don't want purple juice in your pudding, cook it without berries, then garnish with berries after it's cooked.

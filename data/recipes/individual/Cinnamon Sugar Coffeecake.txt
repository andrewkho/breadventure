     Coffeecake  2 teaspoons SAF Gold instant yeast 298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon salt 25g sugar 1 large egg 57g butter 170g milk  Topping  57g butter, melted 149g sugar, mixed with 2 teaspoons cinnamon 
    
     Directions   Place the yeast, flour, salt, sugar, egg, butter and milk in the bread pan of a 1 1/2-pound bread machine in the order listed.  Program for your machine's dough (non-bake) mode, and press Start. If your machine doesn't have a dough mode, simply let it go through both kneading cycles and the first rise, then cancel the machine.   Remove the dough from the machine, and let it rest for 10 minutes.   Shape the dough to fit a 14" pizza pan, and top it with the topping ingredients of butter, sugar, and cinnamon.  Preheat the oven to 375°F.  Let the dough rise for 15 minutes — it will become slightly puffy.  Bake the coffeecake for 15 to 18 minutes, or until it's brown and bubbly.  Remove the coffeecake from the oven and serve warm.  Store the coffeecake, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

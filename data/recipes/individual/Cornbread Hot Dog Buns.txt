Cornbread Hot Dog Buns
    
    Inspired by corn dogs, these yeasted buns are spiked with cornmeal and have the slight crunch and flavor of cornbread. At the same time, they're just as soft and tender as your favorite traditional hot dog buns, yet still perfectly capable of securely cradling your preferred frank and condiments. For a Vermont-inspired King Arthur Flour dog, top with a sweet maple/Sriracha slaw.
    
       390g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 138g cornmeal 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne or chili pepper, optional, for heat 2 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast 227g lukewarm water 57g unsalted butter, melted 57g maple syrup or 50g granulated sugar 2 large eggs 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, and mix and knead to make a smooth dough, adding additional flour or water if necessary.   Let the dough rise, covered, until nearly doubled in bulk, 60 to 90 minutes.  Lightly grease a New England Hotdog Bun Pan.  Gently deflate the dough, and stretch it until it's about 15" long and 6" wide. Place the dough into the pan, stretching it to the edges.  Let the dough rise for 45 to 60 minutes, until it comes to within 1/2" of the top of the pan.   Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Grease a baking sheet, and place it on top of the risen buns, to keep them flat as they bake.  Put the covered buns into the oven, weighing the baking sheet down with something heavy and oven-safe; a cast iron skillet works well.  Bake the buns for 20 minutes, remove the weighted baking sheet, and bake for 2 to 5 minutes longer, if necessary, to brown the buns. A digital thermometer inserted into the center will read 195°F to 200°F.  Remove the pan from the oven, and cool the buns in the pan for 5 minutes. Turn them out onto a rack, rounded side up, to cool completely.  Slice each bun down the middle vertically, without cutting through the bottom; then cut between the buns to separate them.

Seeded Hamburger Buns
    
    Soft buns, topped with crunchy seeds, are a perfect complement to grilled burgers.
    
     Buns  170g lukewarm water 1 large egg 28g butter or oil 25g sugar 2 tablespoons sesame seeds whole golden flax seeds or Everything Bread and Bagel Topping  2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon onion powder, optional  326g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour  Topping  2 tablespoons Everything Bread and Bagel Topping or whole flax seeds 1 large egg white, or Quick Shine spray 
    
     Directions   To make the dough: Combine all of the dough ingredients, and mix and knead them, by hand, mixer, or bread machine, to make a soft dough.   Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let it rise in a warm place for an hour, until it's almost doubled in size.   Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface, flatten it slightly, and divide it into 6 pieces, each weighing about 3 1/2  to 4 ounces.  Roll each piece into a ball.   Place balls into the greased cups of a hamburger bun pan, flattening gently.   Cover and let rise until the buns have doubled in size. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 375Â°F.    Bake the buns for 10 minutes. Remove them from the oven, brush with lightly beaten egg white (or spray with Quick Shine) and sprinkle with seed topping; do this quickly, or the seeds won't stick!     Return the buns to the oven and bake for 5 to 8 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove from the oven, and cool on a rack.

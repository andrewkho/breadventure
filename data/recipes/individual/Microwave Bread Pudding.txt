Check and see if it's still liquid. If it is, microwave in 30-second bursts, till pudding is cooked all the way to the center; the very center can still look a bit uncooked, but it shouldn't be liquid.  Remove from the microwave. If desired, drizzle with maple syrup or melted caramel or fudge sauce or... Serve warm; whipped cream or ice cream are always welcome.

Autumn Bread Pudding
    
    Jewels of the baking world, brioche and challah provide tenderness in a bread pudding, while the glowing dried cranberries and apricots bring sparkle and tang to this fall dessert. It's pretty enough to serve to guests, or for a special breakfast.
    
       255g cubed leftover bread (brioche and challah are nice) 6 large eggs 99g sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg 1/2 teaspoon salt 454g milk 227g half & half, cream, or milk 425g can pears in light syrup 64g dried apricots 57g dried cranberries 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 13" baking dish.  Whisk the eggs in a large bowl. Add the sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg, and salt, and whisk until thoroughly combined. Add the milk and half and half, continuing to whisk.  Stir the bread into the egg mixture, using a large spoon or spatula to mix everything together until the bread is thoroughly coated. Let stand for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.  Drain the pears, reserving the syrup for another use if desired. Dice the pears into 1" pieces. Cut the dried apricots into slivers. (Scissors sprayed with a little non-stick vegetable oil spray work well here.)  Fold all the fruit into the bread-custard mixture and pour it into the baking pan. Bake for 50 minutes to 60 minutes, until the pudding is puffed, lightly browned, and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Let the pudding cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. Drizzle with caramel sauce and serve with ice cream, if desired.

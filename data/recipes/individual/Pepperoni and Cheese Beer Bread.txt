Pepperoni and Cheese Beer Bread
    
    A simple classic, this batter can be baked in a loaf pan or spooned into the wells of a cast iron biscuit pan, for an even quicker snack. The beer you choose will have a lot to say about the flavor profile of the finished bread. 
    
       361g King Arthur Unbleached Self-Rising Flour 25g sugar 57g unsalted butter, melted 340g beer 113g sliced mini pepperoni 113g grated Colby or Pepper Jack Cheese, divided 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Mix the flour, sugar, melted butter, and the beer, stirring until fairly smooth; stir in the pepperoni and 3/4 cup of the cheese.   Spoon the batter into the prepared pan, smoothing the top. Sprinkle with the remaining 1/4 cup of cheese.  Bake for 45 to 50 minutes, until a toothpick inserted about 1/2" into the top of the loaf comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs clinging to it.  Remove the bread from the oven, and after 5 minutes turn it out onto a rack to cool. Wait until the bread cools completely before slicing. Store airtight at room temperature.   Yield: 1 loaf, about 16 servings.

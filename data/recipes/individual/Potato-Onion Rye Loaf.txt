Potato-Onion Rye Loaf
    
    This moist, flavorful rye loaf is great for sandwiches — especially Reubens!
    
       340g boiling water 32g wheat berries 266g first clear flour 103g medium rye or 106g pumpernickel 35g potato flour 1 tablespoon King Arthur Whole-Grain Bread Improver or vital wheat gluten 25g vegetable oil 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 1 to 2 teaspoons Deli Rye Flavor (optional, but VERY good)  1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 teaspoon caramel color (optional)  50g "french-fried onions" 
    
     Directions   Pour the boiling water over the rye berries, and cool to lukewarm.  Add the remaining ingredients (except the onions) and mix, then knead — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — to form a slightly sticky, shiny dough.   Knead in the onions, place the dough into a greased bowl, and cover. Let rise in warm spot for 1 to 2 hours, until it's grown by at least a third.    Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased or floured work surface and form it into one large (15" to 16") batard, or two smaller loaves. Cover and allow to rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until puffy looking.   While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 425°F.  Just before baking, spritz the bread with water and make four or five 1/4" deep diagonal slashes in the top of the crust.  Bake the large loaf for 10 minutes in the oven, then reduce oven heat to 350°F and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes.   For two smaller loaves, turn the oven down immediately and bake at 350°F for 25 to 30 minutes.  The bread will be done when its interior registers 195°F on an instant-read thermometer, the loaf is well-colored, and it feels lighter to pick it up. Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack.  Store, well-wrapped, for 3 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

Ricotta Chive Bread
    
    Made start to finish in a bread machine, this bread has a tender crumb and is filled with flecks of green from the chives. If you have wild leeks (ramps) growing in your yard, use them in place of chives.
    
       227g lukewarm water 85g whole or part-skim ricotta cheese 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 14g granulated sugar 361g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 28g chopped chives or chopped wild leek leaves 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.   Program the machine for basic bread, light crust, and press Start.   Check the dough's consistency about 7 minutes after the kneading cycle begins, adding additional water or flour to form a soft, smooth ball of dough. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.   Cool the loaf completely before serving. Store bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Don't have a bread machine? Mix, knead, and shape the dough, then let it rise until very puffy. Deflate the dough, shape it into a log, and place it in an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" pan. Cover the pan, let it rise until it's crowned about 1" over the pan's rim, uncover, and bake in a preheated 350Â°F oven for about 35 to 40 minutes, until it tests done.

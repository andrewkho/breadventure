Peppery Cheese Sticks
    
    These soft breadsticks — tender and chewy-crunchy, flavored with black pepper and a hint of cheese — are simply addictive.
    
       390g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast 21g Vermont cheese powder 50g olive oil, plus extra for brushing over the dough 32g grated Parmesan cheese 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1 1/2 teaspoons coarsely ground black pepper 227g water 18g to 25g toasted sesame seeds or 11g to 18g ounce grated Parmesan cheese 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease (or line with parchment) two baking sheets.  Combine all of the ingredients except the seeds — by hand, mixer or bread machine — mixing to form a shaggy dough.  Knead the dough for 10 minutes. Allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead for an additional 10 minutes, until it's smooth and supple.  Roll the dough, on a lightly oiled work surface, into a 10" x 18" rectangle.  Brush the rectangle with water and sprinkle with seeds or Parmesan.  Cut the dough into strips 1/3" wide, 10" long, shaping each strip into a twist by rolling the ends in opposite directions.  Place them on the prepared baking sheets. Let the twists rise, covered, for about 30 minutes, until they look slightly puffy.  Bake the breadsticks in the preheated oven for 18 to 22 minutes, until they're golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and cool on a rack.  Store for up to 2 days, well-wrapped at room temperature, or freeze for up to a month.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Thinner breadsticks will bake up crisper, if you space them out on the baking sheet.

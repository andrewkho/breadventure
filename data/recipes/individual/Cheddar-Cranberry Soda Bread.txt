Cheddar-Cranberry Soda Bread
    
    This bread is like a giant scone, marrying the sharpness of Vermont cheddar with the tangy sweetness of dried cranberries. We're partial to Cabot cheddar, but feel free to use your own favorite cheese, no matter how sharp or mellow. Be sure to use a sharp serrated knife to cut the loaf, otherwise you'll end up with a pile of crumbs — which are difficult to slather in soft butter!
    
       298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 57g Vermont cheese powder 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 57g cold unsalted butter, cut into 1/2" dice 227g sharp or extra-sharp cheddar cheese, grated; we prefer Cabot extra-sharp  85g dried cranberries 85g chopped walnuts, optional 283g buttermilk or 170g plain (not Greek) yogurt + 113g milk 1 large egg 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 375°F. Lightly grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.  Combine the flour, cheese powder, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.   Work in the butter until the mixture is crumbly.   Stir in the cheese, cranberries, and walnuts.  Mix the buttermilk and egg, and gently stir into the dry ingredients.   Scoop the dough into the pan, spreading it to the edges.  Bake the bread for 65 to 75 minutes, tenting it with foil for the final 10 to 15 minutes of baking, until a tester inserted into the center comes out clean. Its internal temperature at the center will be about 200°F.  Remove the bread from the oven, and loosen the edges with a table knife. Wait 5 minutes, then gently turn it out onto a rack to cool. Don't slice while hot; it'll crumble.  Yield: 1 loaf, 8 to 12 servings.

Maple-Walnut Oat Bread
    
    Whole wheat and oats are the featured whole grains in this soft, high-rising sandwich loaf. 
    
       255g lukewarm water 39g maple syrup 57g unsalted butter, diced 149g old-fashioned rolled oats, ground for 30 seconds in a blender or food processor 85g King Arthur Premium Whole Wheat Flour 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 28g maple sugar or brown sugar ¼ to ½ teaspoon maple flavor, to taste (optional) 1 ¼ teaspoons salt 2 ½ teaspoons instant yeast 113g chopped walnuts 
    
     Directions   Combine all the dough ingredients, and mix and knead them  — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — until you have a soft, smooth dough.   Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or 8-cup measure (the measure lets you track the dough's progress as it rises), and let it rise until nearly doubled in bulk, 1 to 2 hours.   Lightly grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.   Gently deflate the dough, and shape it into a 9" log. Place it in the prepared pan. Cover the pan and let the bread rise until it crowns about 1 ½" over the rim of the pan, 1 ½ to 2 ½ hours.   Preheat the oven to 350°F.   Uncover the bread, and bake it for 40 to 45 minutes, tenting it with foil after 15 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center will register 190°F when the loaf is done. Remove the bread from the oven, and after about a minute turn out onto a rack to cool.   Yield: one 9" x 5" loaf.

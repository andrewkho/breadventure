Multigrain Brown Bread
    
    This bread is tender, sweet and a delicate beige color. The first few ingredients are mixed together in a blender to homogenize the flavors. The loaf is not a lid-bumper, but it will rise at least two-thirds of the way up the pan.
    
     1 1/2-pound Loaf  170g milk 113g water 25g canola oil (or other vegetable oil) 32g honey 21g raisins 25g dark brown sugar 177g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 149g King Arthur Premium 100% Whole Wheat Flour 78g medium rye flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   In a blender, blend the milk, water, oil, honey, raisins and brown sugar.  Put this mixture, along with the remaining ingredients, into the pan of your bread machine.  Program the machine for basic white bread, light crust, and press Start.  Check the dough with about 10 minutes remaining in the final kneading cycle, and adjust the texture by adding flour or water as needed; the dough should be smooth and supple. Allow the machine to complete its cycle.  Store the bread, well-wrapped, on the counter for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

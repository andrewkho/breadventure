Raisin Rye Bread
    
    Dark, chewy, raisin-studded rye bread is a French classic, and is often found served with cheese. It's also a hearty breakfast bread.
    
       159g Rye Flour Blend, or flour mix in tips below 177g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 39g brown sugar 283g water 2 teaspoons instant yeast 28g butter 57g chopped pecans 142g currants or 170g raisins 
    
     Directions   In a large mixing bowl, or in the bowl of an electric mixer, combine all of the ingredients except the currants and pecans, mixing them to form a shaggy dough.   Knead the dough, by hand or by machine, for 10 minutes.  Allow it to rest for 10 minutes, then knead for an additional 10 minutes, until it's smooth and supple, kneading in the currants and pecans during the final couple of minutes.   Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, and allow it to rest for 1 hour. It'll become quite puffy, though it may not double in bulk. You may also use your bread machine, set on the Dough cycle, to prepare the dough to this point.  Shape the dough into a ball, and place it on a lightly greased sheet pan.   Cover the pan with a dough cover or some lightly greased plastic wrap.  Allow the loaf to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour, or until it's puffy.   Toward the end of the rise, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the bread for about 40 minutes (tenting it lightly with aluminum foil for the final 15 minutes) until its interior registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer.   Store the bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for up to 5 days or in the freezer for up to 3 months.

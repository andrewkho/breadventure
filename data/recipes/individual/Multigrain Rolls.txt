Multigrain Rolls
    
    These rolls pack a wide variety of whole grains. But don't worry, you won't have to buy a dozen different bags of flour for multigrain goodness. Our whole-grain flour blend combines nine whole grains for an easy and convenient shortcut to these soft, moist, slightly sweet rolls.
    
       255g lukewarm water 85g molasses 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast  57g butter, softened 18g golden flax meal 14g wheat germ 21g quick-cooking oats 170g King Arthur Whole Grain Flour Blend 241g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 
    
     Directions   Mix and then knead all of the ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine set on the dough cycle — to make a soft, smooth dough; adjust its consistency with additional flour or water as needed.  Cover the dough, and allow it to rise for 60 to 90 minutes, or until it's somewhat puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk.  Gently deflate the dough, and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface.  Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces, and round each piece into a smooth ball.  Lightly grease a 9" round pan — we like our stoneware bun pan — and space the rolls evenly in the pan.  Cover the pan, and allow the rolls to rise until they're crowded against one another and quite puffy, about 60 to 90 minutes.   Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the rolls for 28 to 30 minutes, until they're golden brown on top and the edge of the center roll springs back lightly when you touch it. A digital thermometer inserted into the middle of the center roll should register at least 190°F.  Remove the rolls from the oven, and brush with melted butter, if desired.   After a couple of minutes, turn the rolls out of the pan onto a rack to cool.   Store well-wrapped at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.

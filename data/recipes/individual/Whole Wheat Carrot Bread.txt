Whole Wheat Carrot Bread
    
    Terry Magestro entered this bread in the Wisconsin State Fair. Her mother baked leftover vegetables into all kinds of breads, and this loaf carries on the tradition. The dough also makes excellent (and colorful) dinner rolls. 
    
       85g  puréed cooked carrots 28g brown sugar 28g unsalted butter 3/4 teaspoon salt 170g water 142g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour or Premium Whole Wheat Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast or active dry yeast 241g to 269g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 
    
     Directions   In a medium saucepan, combine the carrot pur&eacutee, brown sugar, butter, and salt and heat just until warm and the butter is almost melted. Remove from the heat, and transfer to the bowl of your mixer. Add the water, whole wheat flour, and yeast; mix well.    Add the all-purpose flour 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Use the last 1/4 cup to adjust the dough's consistency while kneading.   Knead for 6 to 8 minutes, until the dough is smooth and and elastic. Place in a greased bowl, turn over, then cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.   After the first rise, deflate the dough and shape it into a loaf. Place in a greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan. Cover with greased plastic, and let rise until it domes 1" above the rim of the pan.   While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.   Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the center reads 190°F when measured with a digital thermometer. Remove from the oven, tip the bread out of its pan, and cool on a rack before slicing.

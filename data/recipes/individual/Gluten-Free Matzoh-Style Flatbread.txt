Gluten-Free Matzoh-Style Flatbread
    
    Needing a gluten-free alternative for the Passover seder this year? Try our light, crisp, gluten-free version of matzoh and let your traditions live. Note: most of the matzoh prepared using this recipe won't be kosher, since it probably won't be baked quickly enough.
    
       312g Gluten-Free Multi-Purpose Flour 96g almond Flour 113g hot water 1 teaspoon salt (optional) 
    
     Directions   Preheat your oven and baking stone (if you have one) to 450Â°F.   Mix the dry ingredients together and add the water, mixing to make a stiff dough.  Knead the dough briefly (about 8 to 10 turns), and divide it into 18 equal pieces.  Place 3 pieces of dough evenly spaced on a piece of lightly-greased parchment paper, keeping the rest of the dough covered while you work.  Using your hand, press the pieces out into 4" to 4 1/2" circles, or to the desired thickness.  Prick holes across the surface of each disk with a docking tool or fork and either place the sheet of parchment on a baking sheet or directly on a preheated baking stone.  Bake the matzoh, rotating them halfway through (front to back, back to front; and top to bottom, bottom, to top if you've got two pans in the oven), for 10 minutes, or until the edges are just lightly brown.  Yield: 18 servings

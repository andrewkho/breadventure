Molasses Multi-Seed Bread
    
    After much trial and error, here's a reliable recipe for a moist, high-rising loaf that keeps well, slices easily and, of course, contains a hefty dose of molasses, as well as an interesting crunch from four kinds of seeds. A great bread with which to expand your toast repertoire (try it in French toast sometime, too, for a more unusual rendition), it's also delicious plain and untoasted. Its rising time is a bit longer than usual for sandwich bread, but don't rush it; the wait is worth the end result, and that's just plain good.
    
       340g warm milk, 105° to 110°F 227g warm water, 105° to 110°F 57g butter, melted and slightly cooled 227g King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour 482g to 602g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 1/8 teaspoon ascorbic acid 11g instant yeast or active dry yeast 14g salt 28g sunflower seeds 25g poppy seeds 25g sesame seeds 25g whole flax seeds 170g molasses 
    
     Directions   Combine — by hand or mixer — the milk, water, melted butter, white whole wheat flour and 2 cups of the bread flour in a large bowl.  Add the ascorbic acid, yeast and salt, and mix for 2 minutes.  Stir in the seeds and molasses. Add the remaining bread flour gradually, until the dough has formed a smooth ball.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured surface, and knead until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, turning it so the top of the dough is coated with a thin film of oil. Cover it with plastic wrap and let it rise until puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.   Turn the dough onto your counter, divide it in half and shape each piece into a loaf. Place the loaves in two lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pans, cover with plastic wrap and let rise until the dough has just crowned 1" over the top of the pans, about an hour.  Preheat your oven to 375°F.  Bake the bread for 40 to 45 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the center of the loaves registers 190°F. Turn the loaves out onto a wire rack to cool completely.  Store on the counter for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

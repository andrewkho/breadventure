Blueberry Bread
    
    This bread is perfect for a lazy spring morning breakfast. It has a distinct blueberry flavor and cake-like texture. Substitute dried apricots or cranberries for the blueberries, if desired.
    
     Dough  283g milk 1 teaspoon vanilla 43g unsalted butter 50g sugar 2 teaspoons salt 390g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 74g rolled oats 2 teaspoons instant yeast 78g dried blueberries  Topping  14g melted butter 11g Cinnamon-Sugar Plus glazing sugar or confectioners' sugar 
    
     Directions   Mix together all of the ingredients except the blueberries and topping — by hand, mixer, or in a bread machine — until you've created a smooth, elastic dough.  Add the blueberries, kneading until they're evenly incorporated.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover, and let rise until not quite doubled, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.  Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  Shape the dough into a loaf and place it in the loaf pan. Cover the pan and let the dough rise until it crowns over the rim of the pan, about 1 hour.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake for 40 to 45 minutes. Remove the loaf from the oven when it's golden brown and firm to the touch, turning it out onto a rack to cool.  Brush the loaf with the melted butter, and sprinkle it lightly with cinnamon sugar. Let it cool, then sprinkle it with glazing or confectioners' sugar.  Store at room temperature for 5 days, well-wrapped, or freeze for 3 months.

Whole Grain Pumpkin Yeast Bread
    
    A tender bread, with a hint of spice and sweetness, great for toast or sandwiches. This dough would also make wonderful sandwich rolls or dinner rolls to go with your turkey dinner.
    
       57g water 53g brown sugar 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 227g canned or pureed pumpkin 170g King Arthur Whole Wheat Flour (white or premium) 213 to 241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger 1/2 teaspoon allspice 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon 
    
     Directions   Combine the ingredients in the order listed, by hand, in your bread machine set on the dough cycle, or in your stand mixer. Use the lesser amount of all-purpose flour to begin.   Mix and knead until the dough comes together, then touch lightly with your finger. If it's very sticky, add the remaining 1/4 cup of flour, a tablespoon at a time, until the dough is soft and smooth, but not sticky.  Allow the dough a first rise of about 45 minutes, or let the bread machine finish its dough cycle.   Deflate the dough and shape into a loaf. Transfer to a greased 9" x 5" loaf pan and cover lightly with greased plastic wrap.   Preheat your oven to 350°F. Let the dough rise until the center crests 1" above the rim of the pan, then uncover and bake for 45 top 50 minutes until the center reads 190°F when measured with an instant-read thermometer.   Remove from the oven and tilt out of the pan. Place on a rack to cool before slicing.   Yield: one 9" x 5" loaf, approx. 16 slices

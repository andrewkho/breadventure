     Pereg spice blend  28g poppy seeds 1 tablespoon yellow mustard seeds 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon ground aniseed 1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon dried oregano 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper  Batter  227g unsalted butter, softened 425g brown sugar 448g to 510g mashed ripe bananas 156g lightly packed peeled and grated apple 4 large eggs 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 170g labneh cheese or sour cream 198g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 64g chickpea flour 53g amaranth flour 2 teaspoons baking soda 1/2 teaspoon salt 28g Pereg Spice Blend 50g dried banana chips, lightly crushed 
    
     Directions   To make the spice blend: Mix together all of the ingredients; store in an airtight container.  Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease two 8 1/2" x 4" loaf pans, or one loaf pan and one standard muffin tin.  To make the batter: In a large bowl, beat together the butter and brown sugar. Mix in the mashed bananas and grated apple, then the eggs, one at a time. The mixture will break and curdle; that's OK.   Add the vanilla and labneh (or sour cream), then all of the remaining ingredients. Scrape the bowl and mix for 30 seconds more.  Divide the batter between the pans, using 4 cups of batter for each (fill the wells of the muffin tin almost to the top; the muffins won't rise a lot).  Bake the loaves for 50 to 55 minutes, until a paring knife inserted in the center comes out clean. Bake the muffins for 20 to 24 minutes, until a skewer inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove from the oven and cool on a rack for 10 minutes before tipping out of the pans and returning to the rack to cool completely.  Store any leftovers, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.

Pineapple-Dijon Bread
    
    Deconstruct your favorite flavors of a pineapple-glazed ham, and put them in a loaf of bread instead. The flavor is subtle, but the loaf has an unmistakable mustard aroma. Add thinly sliced ham or prosciutto for different twist on Sunday dinner.
    
       170g warm water 227g canned crushed pineapple, well drained (See "tips", below.) 32g prepared Dijon-style mustard 7g  dry mustard powder 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 11g canola oil 418g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 39g semolina 2 teaspoons instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.  Program the machine for basic bread, light crust, and press Start.  Check the dough's consistency about 7 minutes after the kneading cycle begins, adding additional water or flour to form a soft, smooth ball of dough.  Allow the machine to complete its cycle.  Cool the loaf completely before serving.  Store at room temperature, well-wrapped, for up to 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  Please use canned pineapple only â€” don't use fresh. Canned pineapple has gone through a cooking process that destroys the enzymes that consume protein; if you use fresh pineapple, these enzymes will turn your bread to mush.

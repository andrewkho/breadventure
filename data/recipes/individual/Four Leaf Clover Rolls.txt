       241g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 110g King Arthur Irish-Style Wholemeal Flour 1 teaspoon salt 43g honey 28g soft unsalted butter 227g lukewarm water 2 teaspoons instant yeast 57g toasted walnuts, optional 71g currants, optional 28g melted butter, optional; for a glossy finish 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead all the ingredients — by hand, stand mixer, or bread machine set to the dough cycle — until the dough is smooth and elastic.  Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover, and let it rest for 60 to 90 minutes, until puffy but not necessarily doubled in bulk.  Grease eight 5-ounce or 6-ounce ramekins.  Gently deflate the dough, divide it into 32 pieces, and shape each piece into a ball. It helps to first divide the dough into eight medium balls, and then further divide these into four balls each.   Place four balls into each of the ramekins. Cover the pans and let the rolls rise for 45 to 75 minutes, until they've crested over the rims of the ramekins.  Preheat the oven to 350°F.  Bake the rolls for 25 to 30 minutes, until they're golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into their centers reads 200°F.  Brush the rolls with the melted butter, and let them cool for 5 minutes in the ramekins. Turn them out onto a rack to finish cooling. Serve warm, or at room temperature.  Yield: 8 large rolls.

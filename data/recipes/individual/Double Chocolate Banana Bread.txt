Double Chocolate Banana Bread
    
    Chocolate meets banana in this version of one of the most popular breads we know. We like to make two mini loaves so one can be eaten straight away, and the other can be tucked away for later.
    
       120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon salt 11g King Arthur All-Purpose Baking Cocoa, or Dutch-process cocoa 113g soft unsalted butter 99g sugar 1 large egg 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 227g mashed banana (about 2 medium bananas) 113g sour cream 170g semisweet chocolate chips, chocolate mini chips preferred 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Lightly grease two 3 1/4" x 5 3/4" mini loaf pans, or one 9" x 5" loaf pan.    Combine the flour, baking soda, salt, and cocoa.    In a separate bowl, beat the butter and sugar until light and creamy.    Beat in the egg, then stir in the vanilla, banana, and sour cream.    Gently mix in the dry ingredients and chocolate chips until well incorporated.    Pour the batter into the pan(s) and bake for 45 to 60 minutes (bake for the shorter time for two mini loaves and the longer time for the larger loaf), until a cake tester or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.    Remove the bread(s) from the oven, and allow to rest in the pan(s) for 10 minutes. Turn the bread(s) out onto a rack to cool completely.    Yield: one 9" x 5" loaf or two mini loaves.

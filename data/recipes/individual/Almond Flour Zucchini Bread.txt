       340g grated zucchini 312g King Arthur Gluten-Free Flour 96g almond flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1/4 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 3/4 teaspoon xanthan gum 1 teaspoon cinnamon 3 large eggs 99g vegetable oil 99g granulated sugar 106g brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F with its rack in the center. Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.   Press the water from the zucchini by placing the grated zucchini into a dishtowel. Wring the towel until no more water comes out. You'll end up with about 1 1/2 cups of zucchini. Set it aside.  Whisk together the flours, baking powder, baking soda, salt, xanthan gum, and cinnamon. Set them aside.  In a large bowl beat together the eggs, oil, sugars, and vanilla.   Add the dry ingredients and mix until fully combined. Stir in the zucchini.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan and bake the bread for 60 to 65 minutes, until it's started to brown and a cake tester inserted into the center comes out clean.  Remove the bread from the oven, and let it cool completely on a rack. Store well-wrapped, at room temperature, for several days; freeze for longer storage.  Yield: 1 loaf.

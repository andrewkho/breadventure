       269g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 113g King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour or King Arthur Premium Whole Wheat Flour 74g Harvest Grains Blend 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 25g golden flax meal 24g non-diastatic malt powder or 39g brown sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 340g water 11g vegetable oil 2 teaspoons instant yeast  Topping (optional)  28g butter, melted 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients and mix and knead to form an elastic, slightly sticky dough.  Allow the dough to rise in a lightly greased bowl until it's almost doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours.  Turn the dough onto a lightly floured or lightly oiled work surface.  Divide it into 16 pieces, and roll each piece into a ball.  Place the balls in a lightly greased 11" x 11" pan or into two 8" or 9" round pans.  Cover and allow to rise for about 1 hour, until very puffy.  Preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake the buns in a preheated 375°F oven for 20 to 24 minutes, until they're lightly browned.  Remove from the oven and brush with melted butter if desired (for a soft crust).  Store, well-wrapped, for 4 days at room temperature. Freeze for up to a month.

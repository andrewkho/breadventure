Tender Potato & Onion Bread
    
    This tender, golden loaf, studded with bits of browned onion, is a wonderful accompaniment to the traditional corned beef and cabbage supper. We also think it's grand as a breakfast bread, toasted (or not) and served alongside eggs and bacon and sausage. Or pair it with a nice cheese souffle and a salad, and there's your light supper.
    
       269g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 3/4 teaspoon salt 11g sugar 2 teaspoons Pizza Dough Flavor (optional, but good) 64g "french-fried" onions or 202g diced, sautéed onions (See "tips", below.) 227g buttermilk or sour cream, not non-fat 28g butter, melted 2 large eggs 241g unseasoned mashed potatoes, packed firmly into the measuring cup 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.  In a medium-sized mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, sugar, Pizza Dough Flavor (if you're using it), and onions.  In a separate bowl, or in a large measuring cup, whisk together the buttermilk or sour cream, the melted butter, and the eggs.   Stir the liquid ingredients and the potato into the dry ingredients, mixing just until thoroughly combined.  Spoon the batter into the pan.  Bake the bread for about 1 hour, or until it's a very light golden brown, and a cake tester inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean.  Allow to cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then turn it onto a rack to cool.  Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.  
    
     Tips from our bakers  "French-fried" onions are found in a can at the supermarket. If you don't have them, use 3 cups chopped Spanish or sweet onion (1 large onion, 15 ounces peeled), sautéed in 2 tablespoons olive oil until golden, for about 1 cup (7 1/8 ounces) sautéed onions.

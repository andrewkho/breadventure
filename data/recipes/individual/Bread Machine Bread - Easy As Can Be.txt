Bread Machine Bread - Easy As Can Be
    
    King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour is perfect for bread machines. Its high protein level (11.7 grams per cup), and the quality of that protein, allows you to use it in recipes calling for either bread flour or all-purpose flour. This recipe makes a reliably high-rising loaf, with soft, springy texture and nicely balanced flavor.

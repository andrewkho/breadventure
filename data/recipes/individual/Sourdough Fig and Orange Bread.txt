Sourdough Fig and Orange Bread
    
    Just as nice for a hearty, whole-grain breakfast as it is for an afternoon treat, this quick bread is studded with fiber-rich figs and nuts.
    
       120g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 170g King Arthur White Whole Whole Wheat Flour 149g granulated sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 170g sourdough starter, unfed/discard 99g vegetable oil 227g orange juice grated rind (zest) of 1 orange 1 large egg 149g diced dried figs 89g chopped almonds, shelled pistachios, or pine nuts sparkling sugar, for topping; optional 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Grease a 9" x 5" loaf pan.  In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flours, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.   In a separate bowl, whisk together the starter, vegetable oil, orange juice, orange zest, and egg. Pour the wet mixture into the dry, stirring until evenly moistened. Stir in the figs and nuts.  Transfer the dough to the prepared pan and sprinkle the top with sparkling sugar, if desired.    Bake the bread for 55 to 60 minutes, until a paring knife inserted in the center comes out clean.  Remove the bread from the oven and cool it on a rack in the pan for 15 minutes before turning it out of the pan and returning it to the rack. Cool completely before slicing.  Store the bread, tightly wrapped in plastic, at room temperature for several days; freeze for longer storage.   
    
     Tips from our bakers  Feel free to use fresh figs instead of dried; just dice them and mix in. Reduce the orange juice in the recipe to 3/4 cup (6 ounces).

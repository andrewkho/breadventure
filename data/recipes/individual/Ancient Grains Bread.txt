       2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 170 to 227g lukewarm water* 113g orange juice 25g vegetable oil 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 43g honey 32g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 241g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 113g King Arthur whole wheat flour, Traditional or White Whole Wheat 128g Ancient Grains Blend 1 tablespoon vital wheat gluten *Use the lesser amount of water in summer (or in humid conditions), the greater amount in winter (or in dry conditions), and something in between the rest of the time. 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients, mixing and kneading to form a smooth, slightly sticky dough.   Cover and let rise in a warm spot for about an hour, until doubled in size.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface, shape it into a 8" x 4" log, and put it into a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/4" bread pan, gently flattening it to fill the pan.  Cover the pan and allow the loaf to rise until it's crested about 1" over the rim of the pan.  Bake the bread in a preheated 375°F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, tenting with foil after about 20 minutes to prevent over-browning. Remove from the oven when it's golden brown, and its interior temperature registers 190°F on an instant-read thermometer.   After 5 minutes, turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool.

     Directions   Place all of the ingredients except the nuts and currants in the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer.  Program the machine for whole wheat or whole grain bread (or equivalent, if available; if not, program for basic or white bread), then press start.  Check the dough with about 10 minutes remaining on the final kneading cycle; it should be smooth and just slightly sticky. Adjust the consistency, if necessary, with additional flour or water.  About 5 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, add the nuts and currants.  Allow the machine to complete its cycle.  Store the bread, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

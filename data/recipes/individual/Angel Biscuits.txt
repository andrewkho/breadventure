Angel Biscuits
    
    Part soft yeast roll, part tender biscuit, these buns are an interesting composite. Sometimes called Bride's Biscuits (because even a new bride was supposed to be able to make them easily), they include both yeast and baking powder, for a guaranteed rise. Though they don't rise high, like Southern biscuits do, they're nevertheless a soft, light roll, perfect for splitting in half and filling with a slice of ham or sausage patty.
    
       298g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast 25g sugar 3/4 teaspoon salt 2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder 46g vegetable shortening 57g cold butter, cut into pats 227g room-temperature milk 28g melted butter, for brushing on top 
    
     Directions   Whisk together the flour, yeast, sugar, salt, and baking powder.  Add the shortening, mixing until evenly crumbly.  Add the butter, mixing until roughly combined. Pea-sized bits of butter can remain.  Add the milk, mixing until just combined. The dough will be quite wet.  Transfer the dough to a well-floured work surface, and quickly and gently pat it into a 7" diameter, 1"-thick circle.  Use a 2" round biscuit cutter to cut 9 biscuits. Pat together the scraps, and cut as many additional biscuits as you can. Place them close together on a lightly floured or parchment-lined tray or baking sheet. Cover with lightly greased plastic wrap or the cover of your choice, and allow the biscuits to rest at room temperature for 1 hour.  After an hour, cover the biscuits with plastic wrap, and place the pan in the freezer for at least 1 hour. Overnight is fine. Alternatively, biscuits can be frozen up to 2 months.  When ready to bake, preheat the oven to 400Â°F.  Remove the biscuits from the freezer, remove the plastic, and space them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet.  Bake the biscuits for 16 to 18 minutes, until they're golden brown.  Remove from the oven, and brush with melted butter, if desired.

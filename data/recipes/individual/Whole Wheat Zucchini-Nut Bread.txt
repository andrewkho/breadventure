Whole Wheat Zucchini-Nut Bread
    
    If you want to make a dent in your zucchini surplus, try this bread. It's moist, scented with cinnamon, and studded with golden raisins and walnuts. You can use brown sugar instead of white for a darker, richer loaf.
    
       2 large eggs 85g molasses 99g vegetable oil 99g granulated or 92g brown sugar 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 106g whole wheat pastry flour or King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 89g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1 teaspoon salt 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon baking powder 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 340g shredded, unpeeled zucchini (1 small to medium) 113g raisins (golden are nice) 85g chopped walnuts 
    
     Directions    Preheat the oven to 350Â°F; lightly grease a standard 8 1/2" by 4 1/2" loaf pan, or line it with parchment.  In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs, oil, molasses, sugar, and vanilla until smooth.    In a separate bowl, whisk together the flours, baking soda, baking powder, salt and cinnamon.    Stir the dry ingredients into the wet mixture.   Stir in the zucchini, raisins and walnuts.    Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes, until the loaf tests done (a wooden tester inserted in the center will come out clean). Remove the bread from the oven, and place on a rack to cool for 20 minutes before removing from the pan and returning to the rack to cool completely.

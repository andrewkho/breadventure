Almond Cracked Wheat Bread
    
    The addition of almond paste gives this loaf a tender moistness; it's also a good complement to the nutty flavor of cracked wheat. The almond flavor isn't pronounced, but adds a delicate hint of sweetness.
    
       255g water 28g unsalted butter 50g almond paste (See "tips", below.) 25g sugar 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 110g cracked wheat or bulgur 85g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 241g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 14g nonfat dried milk 1 1/2 teaspoons regular instant yeast 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine, program the machine for Basic White Bread, and press Start.  Check the dough after 10 to 15 minutes of kneading; it should have formed a smooth ball, soft but not sticky. If necessary, adjust the dough's consistency with additional flour or water.  Allow the machine to complete its cycle.  Store well-wrapped at room temperature for 5 days, or frozen for 3 months.

     Directions   To make the dough: Mix and knead all of the ingredients together — by hand, mixer, or using the dough cycle on a bread machine — to make a smooth, soft dough. Cover the dough and let it rise until it's puffy, about 1 1/2 hours.  To make the topping: Melt the butter in a sauté pan, add the onions and salt, and cook for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally to brown the onions evenly.  Preheat the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease three canape bread tubes. (See "tips", below.)  Divide the dough into three pieces, and shape each into a log. Place in canapé tubes, attaching the caps at both ends.  Immediately place the bread in the oven, and bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until the crust is brown and its internal temperature is 190°F.  Remove from the oven, remove the caps, and cool in the tubes for 10 minutes. Remove from the tubes, and cool completely on a rack.  Cut the cool loaves into 3/8"-thick slices. Top each slice with 1 tablespoon of the caramelized onions and crumbles of goat cheese.   Toast the canapés in a 350°F oven for 10 minutes. Garnish with chives. Serve warm.   
    
     Tips from our bakers  Don't have canapé tubes? Substitute a standard (13" x 4" x 4") lidded pain de mie pan, baking for 35 to 40 minutes and removing the lid after 25 minutes of baking. Or bake in a 9" x 5" pan for about 40 minutes.To prevent canapé tubes from rolling around the oven, put them in a 9" x 13" pan; the three will fit perfectly together.

Strawberry Banana Bread
    
    This quick banana bread is given a visual pop with brilliant strawberries.
    
     Dough  510g mashed bananas (about 3 large) 227g butter or margarine, softened  213g light brown sugar 6 egg whites, well-beaten 2 teaspoons baking soda 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoon ground mace or nutmeg 1 teaspoon salt 177g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 255g King Arthur Premium 100% Whole Wheat Flour or White Whole Wheat Flour 167g fresh strawberries, chopped  Topping  25g granulated sugar 1/4 teaspoon ground mace or nutmeg 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease and flour two standard 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pans. Set aside.  Cream the bananas and the margarine together and beat in the brown sugar. Mix in the egg whites.  In a separate bowl, use a whisk to stir together the baking soda, baking powder, mace, salt, and flours.  Add the dry mixture to the creamed mixture.  Gently fold in the strawberries.  Divide the dough evenly between the two prepared pans.  To make the topping: mix the sugar with the mace or nutmeg, and sprinkle it over the loaves.  Bake the loaves for approximately 50 minutes, or until a cake tester inserted into the center of a loaf comes out clean.  Let loaves cool in pans for 10 minutes and finish cooling on racks. These are fragile while still hot.  Store, well-wrapped, for up to 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

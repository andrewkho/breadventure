Roasted Garlic Potato Bread
    
    This filling and hearty loaf is a great accompaniment to soup or fondue on a cold winter's night.
    
       482g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 46g potato flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast 2 teaspoons Pizza Seasoning 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 340g water 21g olive oil 113g garlic, baked 454g to 510g, raw weight, roasted potatoes diced in 1/2"-chunks 
    
     Directions   Combine the flour, potato flour, yeast, Pizza Seasoning, salt, water and olive oil, and mix and knead them together — by hand, mixer or bread machine — until you've made a soft, smooth dough.  Remove the baked garlic from its skin by gently squeezing. Knead in the garlic and then the potatoes.  Allow the dough to rise, covered, for 1 1/2 to 2 hours, until it has doubled.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased surface and knead gently to deflate it, then shape it into a ball. Some potatoes may pop out — that's fine.   Place the loaf into a lightly greased 9" to 10" round baker or cake pan (this will help the bread rise in an even shape), or onto a baking sheet.  Cover with lightly greased plastic wrap or a proof cover, and let the loaf rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until puffy.  Preheat the oven to 375°F.   Just before placing the bread in the oven, gently score the top of the bread about 1/2" deep in a grid pattern, and spritz it with water.  Bake the bread for 32 to 38 minutes, until it's deeply browned.   Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out of the pan, and cool it on a rack before slicing.   Store the bread, well-wrapped, for up to 5 days at room temperature or up to 3 months in the freezer.

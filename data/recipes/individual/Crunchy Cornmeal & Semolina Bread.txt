Crunchy Cornmeal & Semolina Bread
    
    You want toast to be crisp and crunchy, right? Well, the cornmeal and semolina (as well as the sesame seeds) add delightful crunch to this bright golden loaf. Just slightly sweet and nutty, it's an ideal candidate for peanut butter and jam. 
    
       74g yellow cornmeal 163g semolina flour 213g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 43g honey 25g oil or 28g butter 283g to 340g water 35g toasted sesame seeds 
    
     Directions   Combine all of the ingredients — by hand, mixer, or bread machine — kneading to form a soft, supple dough.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket, cover the bowl or bucket, and allow the dough to rise until puffy though not necessarily doubled in bulk, about 1 hour, depending on the warmth of your kitchen.  Transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface, and form it into a loaf.  Place the loaf in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan.  Cover the pan and let the bread rise for 1 hour, or until it's just crowned over the edge of the pan.  While the bread is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F.  Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes, or until it's golden brown and its internal temperature is about 190°F.  Remove the bread from the oven, and turn it out onto a wire rack to cool completely.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for 5 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

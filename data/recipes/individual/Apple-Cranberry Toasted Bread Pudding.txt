Apple-Cranberry Toasted Bread Pudding
    
    Tangy, creamy, and sweet, this quintessential autumn dessert is adapted from a recipe by Susan Reid, editor of our print newsletter, "The Baking Sheet."
    
       142g sturdy white bread, crusts removed and bread toasted 43g unsalted butter 227g milk 2 large eggs 78g boiled cider or thawed frozen apple juice concentrate 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 50g sugar 1/8 teaspoon salt** 113g diced fresh apples, peeled or not 25g fresh or frozen cranberries; or 1 1/4 ounces dried cranberries sparkling white sugar or maple sugar, for topping whipped cream flavored with maple syrup or maple sugar, to garnish * Try  King Arthur's Classic White Sandwich Bread. **Increase to 1/4 teaspoon if using unsalted butter. 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Use 1 tablespoon of the butter to grease a small (1-quart) casserole,  an 8" round pan, or four 8 to 10-ounce ramekins; our individual pie slice pans  work well.  Tear the toasted bread into small cubes, and place it in a mixing bowl.   Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons butter with the milk until the butter melts, and pour over the bread. Soak for 10 minutes.   Beat together the eggs, boiled cider, cinnamon, sugar, and salt.   Stir in the diced apples and cranberries. Pour into the prepared dish(es), and sprinkle the tops with sparkling or maple sugar, if desired.   Bake the pudding(s) until golden brown and set, about 30 to 40 minutes (less for individual pans).   Remove from the oven and serve warm, with whipped cream, if desired.   Yield: 4 servings.

Apple-Oat-Barley Bread
    
    Cinnamon adds delicious flavor to this tasty toasting bread.
    
       50g rolled oats* 46g barley flakes* 454g boiling water 1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 1 1/2 teaspoons salt 14g milled flax or 11g vegetable oil 18g vital wheat gluten 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk 312g King Arthur 100% White Whole Wheat Flour 43g dried apples, chopped 128g cinnamon chips or 67g cinnamon sweet bits, optional *Or use all oats, or all barley. 
    
     Directions   Place the oats and barley in a bowl (or the bucket of a bread machine) and pour the boiling water over them.  Cool to lukewarm, about 20 minutes, and stir in the remaining ingredients, except the apples and cinnamon chips or bits.    Stir, then knead to make a soft, slightly sticky dough (or allow to go through the dough cycle of a bread machine). If you're kneading by hand and the dough is very sticky, allow it to rest for 15 minutes before adding more flour.  Add the apples and cinnamon chips or bits at the end of the kneading process, or when indicated by the bread machine.   Let the dough rise, covered, for 1 hour, until it's puffy.  Turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface, knead gently, then form into a loaf or ball.   Place on a greased or parchment-lined baking sheet, or in a greased 9" x 5" loaf pan.   Cover and let rise until almost doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Preheat the oven to 400°F while dough is rising.  Bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes, until it's deep brown and sounds hollow when thumped on the bottom. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf will register 205°F.   Remove it from the oven, cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool completely.   Store, well-wrapped, for 5 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to 3 months.

Russian Black Bread
    
    Fennel seeds give this tender Slavic bread a distinctive licorice flavor, and vinegar gives it slight tang. 
    
       255g lukewarm water 28g apple cider vinegar 106g pumpernickel or rye flour, plus more for dusting 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 28g unsalted butter 43g dark corn syrup or molasses 14g brown sugar 18g black cocoa 1 teaspoon espresso powder or instant coffee powder 1/4 to 1 teaspoon fennel seeds, to taste 1 3/4 teaspoons instant yeast 298g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour, divided 
    
     Directions   Place all of the ingredients in a large bowl, reserving 1 cup of the bread flour. Mix until a sticky dough begins to form.  Mix in the remaining cup of flour and knead for 7 minutes, or until the dough becomes soft and elastic, but may still be somewhat sticky to the touch. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise until doubled, 45 minutes to 1 hour.   After the first rise, shape the dough into an oblong loaf. Place in a greased 9" x 5" or 10" x 5" bread pan, cover with greased plastic, and let rise until almost doubled, about 60 to 90 minutes.  While the dough is rising, preheat the oven to 375°F. When the dough has almost doubled, brush or spray the top with water, dust with pumpernickel or rye flour, and score (slash) the top.   Bake the bread for about 35 minutes, until it sounds hollow when you thump the bottom, or the inside measures 205°F on a digital thermometer. Remove the loaf from the oven and cool it on a rack before slicing.   Store bread well wrapped at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.

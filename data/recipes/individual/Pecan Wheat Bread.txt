Pecan Wheat Bread
    
    This loaf features the rich flavors of both wheat and pecans. Make it start to finish in your bread machine, or let the machine do the initial work, then take it out and bake it in your regular oven. Either way, it's a winner.

     Directions   To bake in a bread machine: Place all of the ingredients into the pan of your bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Program the machine for the basic cycle, and press Start.   Check the dough's consistency about 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle, adding additional water or flour to form a soft, smooth ball of dough. Allow the machine to complete its cycle. Cool the bread completely before serving.   To bake in an oven: Program your bread machine for the dough or manual cycle. When the cycle is complete, remove the dough, and place it in a lightly greased 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" loaf pan.   Allow the dough to rise, covered, for about 1 hour, or until it's crowned about 1" over the rim of the pan.   Bake the bread in a preheated 350°F oven for 35 to 45 minutes, or until it's a deep golden brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center of the loaf registers about 190°F. Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out of the pan, and let it cool on a rack.  Store completely cooled bread, well wrapped, at room temperature for several days. Freeze for longer storage.

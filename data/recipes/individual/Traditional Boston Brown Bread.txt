Traditional Boston Brown Bread
    
    This dark, moist bread is traditionally served with baked beans and franks. It's a cinch to put together, is moist and delicious, and is a Saturday supper Boston tradition. The ingredients can be mixed up quickly; the steaming takes about 2 hours.
    
       138g yellow cornmeal 106g pumpernickel flour 113g King Arthur Premium 100% Whole Wheat Flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon salt 149g raisins; optional, but good 454g buttermilk 255g molasses 
    
     Directions   Mix the cornmeal, flours, baking soda, salt and raisins together. Combine the buttermilk and molasses and stir them into the dry ingredients.  Place the mixture in an 8 1/2" x 4 1/2" bread pan, or 2-quart pudding mold. Cover loosely with foil that has been greased on the inside (to prevent sticking) and secure with a rubber band. Or grease the inside lid of the pudding mold.  Place the pan, or mold, in a kettle or saucepan on top of something (crinkled aluminum foil or a stainless steel vegetable steaming insert will do nicely) to keep the pan off the bottom of the kettle. The kettle should be deep enough so its lid can cover the pudding container.  Fill the kettle with boiling water two-thirds of the way up the pan. Cover, bring the water back to a boil, then lower to a simmer. Steam for about 2 hours, adding water if necessary. The bread is done when a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, or with a few moist crumbs clinging to it.  Remove the bread from the kettle, and let it cool in the pan for about 10 minutes before turning it out of the pan to cool on a rack.  Store, well-wrapped, at room temperature for a day or so. Refrigerate up to several days, or freeze for up to 3 months.

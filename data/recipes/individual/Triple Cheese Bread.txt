Triple Cheese Bread
    
    Three cheeses make this loaf a tender and flavorful treat for   sandwiches. Divided into smaller pieces, it makes excellent   dinner rolls.  
    
       170g warm water 2 teaspoons instant yeast  361g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 25g sugar 1 1/4 teaspoons salt  28g soft butter 57g shredded cheddar cheese 113g cottage cheese 18g Vermont cheese powder or grated Parmesan cheese 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead all of the ingredients — by  hand, in your mixer, or in your bread machine on   the dough cycle — to make a soft dough.    Place the dough in a greased  bowl or other rising container, cover it, and let it rise until doubled, about 45  minutes.    Deflate the dough, form it into a 9" log, and place it in  a greased 9" x 5" loaf pan. Cover loosely with greased  plastic and let rise until the bread domes an inch  above the rim of the pan, about 60 minutes. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.   Bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes, until it's golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers at least 190°F.   Remove the bread from the oven, let it   cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then transfer the loaf to a rack to cool completely before slicing.    Yield: 1 loaf.    
    
     Tips from our bakers  Want to make dinner rolls instead? Divide the risen dough into 12 equal  pieces and shape into balls. Place the balls on a lightly  greased or parchment-lined baking sheet. Cover  loosely with greased plastic and let rise until almost  doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes.

Pane Pugliese
    
    This crusty, slightly domed and delicious peasant bread is made with a very slack (wet) dough. The dough is almost impossible to work with, but produces a pleasingly open texture. A long fermentation enhances the bread's flavor.
    
     Biga  113g cool water 149g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 1/8 teaspoon instant yeast  Dough  all of the biga (above) 340g lukewarm water 482g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon instant yeast 
    
     Directions   In a small mixing bowl, combine the water, flour, and yeast to form a soft dough. Don't knead it; just make sure all of the ingredients are well-incorporated. Set this mixture aside in a warm place, covered, for 12 to 16 hours; overnight is fine.  Knead all of the dough ingredients together, using a mixer or bread machine, until the dough is cohesive and elastic (though not necessarily smooth), about 10 minutes.   Cover the dough and let it rise in a warm place for 2 to 3 hours, gently stirring it down each hour. Letting it rise the full 3 hours will enhance the bread's flavor.  Lightly grease a half-sheet pan or other flat pan; or line with parchment. Scoop the very wet dough, in two separate pieces, onto the pan lengthwise, shaping each piece into a rough oval as best you can.  Cover the dough with heavily greased plastic wrap, and allow it to rise for about 90 minutes. It'll spread quite a bit; don't worry, it's supposed to. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 450Â°F.  Spray the loaves heavily with warm water, and bake them for 25 to 30 minutes, or until they're a deep golden brown.  Turn the oven off, prop the door open, transfer the loaves from the pan to the oven rack, and allow them to cool in the turned-off oven.

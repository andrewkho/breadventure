Spelt Biscuits
    
    Spelt is an ancient strain of wheat that lends a slightly sweet and nutty flavor to baked goods. It's used in many recipes as a blend with wheat for strength, but on its own, spelt makes a delicate bsicuit, pie dough, or cookie.
    
       198g spelt flour 1 teaspoon baking soda 1/4 teaspoon ascorbic acid 1/2 teaspoon salt 50g vegetable oil 113g water 
    
     Directions   Preheat the oven to 400Â°F.  Stir the flour, baking soda, ascorbic acid and salt together in a mixing bowl.   Blend in the oil with a pastry cutter until the mixture is crumbly. Stir in the water until dough holds together.  Turn the dough out onto a spelt-sprinkled board and knead about 25 times.   Roll or pat the dough out until it's about 3/8" in thickness. With a spelt-dipped biscuit cutter, cut out circles and place on a parchment-lined (or ungreased) baking sheet.  Bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes.  Store any leftover rolls, well-wrapped, for up to 3 days at room temperature, or freeze for up to a month.

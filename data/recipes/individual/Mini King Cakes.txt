     Dough  113g butter, melted 170g lukewarm milk 2 large eggs + 1 large egg yolk, white reserved 50g sugar 35g Baker's Special Dry Milk or nonfat dry milk 1 1/4 teaspoons salt 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg 1/8 teaspoon lemon oil, or 1 teaspoon grated lemon rind 418g King Arthur Unbleached All-Purpose Flour 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast  Icing  113g confectioners' sugar ½ teaspoon vanilla extract 1 tablespoon + ½ to 1 teaspoon milk, enough to make a thick but pourable glaze  Topping  yellow, purple, and green sparkling sugars 
    
     Directions   Mix and knead all of the dough ingredients to make a smooth, soft dough.   Let the dough rise, covered, for 1 hour.   Place 12 mini-panettone papers on a baking sheet. Or line a standard muffin pan with cupcake papers, and grease the papers.     With greased hands, divide the sticky dough into 12 equal pieces, forming each into a smooth ball.   Place the balls of dough into the papers. Cover the pan, and let the cakes rise for 1 hour. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.    Whisk the reserved egg white with 1 tablespoon water, and brush it over the cakes.   Bake the cakes for 20 minutes, then tent them lightly with aluminum foil and bake for an additional 20 to 25 minutes, until they're a deep golden brown. Remove them from the oven, and transfer to a rack to cool.   Beat together the icing ingredients, dribbling in the final teaspoon of milk until the icing is thick yet pourable.   Dip the top of each cake in the icing, or drizzle icing over the tops of the cakes. While the icing is still tacky, sprinkle with the colored sugars.   Yield: 12 cakes.

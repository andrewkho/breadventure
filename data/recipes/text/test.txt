oatmeal sandwich bread

oats make a bread which is characteristically tender , moist and just slightly sweet , the perfect foil for sandwich fillings as disparate as peanut butter and marshmallow fluff or bologna and american cheese . and cinnamon toast made with oatmeal bread — the smell of toasted oats mingling with the heady aromas of cinnamon and melting butter — is enough to get anyone 's day off to a very good start indeed .

227 g lukewarm water
74 g lukewarm milk
57 g butter
28 g brown sugar
43 g honey
99 g rolled oats
50 g rolled oats , ground ; or oat flour
2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
10 g king arthur whole grain bread improver ( optional , for best rise )
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
298 g king arthur unbleached bread flour

in a large mixing bowl , or in the bowl of an electric mixer , combine all of the ingredients , mixing to form a shaggy dough . knead the dough by hand ( 10 minutes ) or by mixer ( 5 minutes ) until it 's smooth . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl , and allow it to rest for 1 hour ; it 'll become quite puffy , though it may not double in bulk . gently deflate the dough , and transfer it to a lightly oiled work surface . shape it into an 8 '' log . place the dough in a lightly greased 8 1/2 '' x 4 1/2 '' loaf pan , cover the pan with loosely with lightly greased plastic wrap , and allow the dough to rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour , until it 's crested 1 '' to 2 '' over the rim of the pan . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 350°f . bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes , until a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers 190°f . if the bread appears to be browning too quickly , tent it with aluminum foil for the final 10 minutes of baking . remove the bread from the oven , and turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool . store the bread well-wrapped , at room temperature , for several days ; freeze for longer storage .

tips from our bakers

if you prefer oatmeal bread sweetened the traditional way , with molasses , simply substitute 3 tablespoons molasses for the brown sugar and honey . the resultant bread will be darker in color , and slightly stronger tasting.rolled oats are easily ground using a blender or food processor ; a mini-processor is the perfect tool , because of the small amount being processed . why does this loaf contain both whole and ground rolled oats ? grinding a portion of the oats allows them to disperse more fully throughout the dough , lending it their humectant properties ( in plain english , their ability to hold water , thus slowing down the bread 's staling process ) . and leaving a portion of the oats whole gives the bread texture . all in all , the marriage of oats and wheat flour is a happy one , and a boon to sandwich and toast lovers everywhere.traditionally , oatmeal bread is sweetened with molasses , which gives it a dark color and pronounced burnt-sugar flavor . we choose to lighten the effect here by using brown sugar and honey.want to make this loaf with the help of your bread machine ? place all of the ingredients into the pan of your machine , program the machine for manual or dough , and press start . about 10 minutes before the end of the second kneading cycle , check the dough and adjust its consistency as necessary with additional flour or water ; the finished dough should be soft and supple . shape the loaf and bake it in your regular oven , as directed above .

buns

454 g pastry flour blend or 14 3/4 ounces king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour + 2 1/4 ounces cornstarch
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
25 g sugar
454 to 510 g heavy cream

coating

85 g butter , melted , or 2 5/8 ounces milk
227 to 283 g cinnamon-sugar plus or your own cinnamon-sugar

lightly grease a 12 '' x 9 '' paper tree pan . or grease a 9 '' x 13 '' pan , line with parchment , and grease the parchment . parchment is n't absolutely necessary , but it makes it easier to get the bubbly , sugary buns out of the pan once they 're baked . whisk together the flour , baking powder , salt , and sugar . add 2 cups of the cream all at once , then toss and stir the mixture till the dough comes together . if necessary , add additional cream to make the dough cohesive . gather the dough in your hands and knead it a few times to make sure there are no dry spots . place the cinnamon sugar in a small , shallow bowl or pan ; or in a plastic zip-top bag . break off pieces of dough about the size of a ping pong ball , or about 1 1/8 ounces . dip each piece in melted butter or milk , then roll or shake in the cinnamon-sugar to coat . place the cinnamon-coated dough balls into the pan of your choice in a single layer ; they 'll be touching one another and , in the tree pan , they 'll be quite crowded ( which is perfectly ok ) . you may bake immediately , if you like , for 45 to 50 minutes in a preheated 350°f oven . or cover the pan with plastic , and place in the freezer overnight , or for up to a week or so . if freezing longer than overnight , and using a paper tree pan , wrap the entire pan in plastic wrap , then in foil . next day , remove the pan from the freezer , and let the buns rest at room temperature while you preheat your oven to 350°f . the buns do n't need to thaw . if you 're using a paper tree pan , set it on a baking sheet lined with parchment or foil , to catch any potential drips . if you 're baking the buns immediately ( not frozen ) , bake them for 45 to 50 minutes , till the buns in the center are cooked through . you can asses this by taking a toothpick and actually digging into the center bun to take a look ; it should look totally baked , not doughy . if the buns have been frozen , bake them for 65 to 70 minutes , testing for doneness as instructed above . tent them with aluminum foil after 45 minutes of baking . remove from the oven , and serve immediately , right from the tree pan . if you 've baked in a 9 '' x 13 '' pan , turn the buns out of the pan onto a serving platter . dust with confectioners ' sugar , if desired , right before serving .

tips from our bakers

can you refrigerate these overnight , rather than freeze ? yes , but they wo n't bake up as well . refrigeration slows , but does n't stop the action of the baking powder , so it very gradually loses its punch overnight . but frozen , the baking powder holds up just fine . if you dip the dough balls in butter , the buns will be stickier and richer . a bath in milk produces a `` lighter '' bun , both in taste , and calories .


our easiest stollen

this baking powder version of a classic yeasted holiday favorite ( a.k.a . the i-don't-have-time-to-make-stollen stollen ) is quick , easy , and absolutely delicious . the recipe combines dried fruits and toasted almonds in a tender , buttery dough , with a blizzard-like coating of confectioners ' sugar . even better it makes two loaves : one to enjoy , one to wrap and give away .

dough

269 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
99 g granulated sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt*
113 g cold butter
227 g ricotta cheese , part-skim milk type
1 large egg
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 1/2 teaspoons buttery sweet dough flavor , optional but good
1/4 teaspoon lemon oil or 1/4 teaspoon fiori di sicilia
163 g baker 's fruit blend ; or 1/2 cup golden raisins + 1/2 cup of your favorite dried fruits , chopped to 1/2 '' pieces if necessary
35 g slivered almonds , toasted and cooled
*reduce the salt to 1/4 teaspoon if you use salted butter .

topping

85 g butter , melted
85 g confectioners ' sugar or non-melting white sugar

preheat your oven to 325°f . lightly grease a baking sheet , or line it with parchment . whisk together the flour , sugar , baking powder , and salt in a mixing bowl . cut the cold butter into small chunks , then blend it into the flour mixture to form uneven crumbs . in a separate bowl , mix together the cheese , egg , vanilla , and flavors . toss the fruit and almonds with the flour mixture until evenly distributed . then combine the wet and dry ingredients , mixing until most of the flour is moistened . turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface , and knead it two or three times , until it holds together . divide it in half . roll each piece of dough into an 8 '' x 7 '' oval about 1/2 '' thick . fold each piece of dough roughly in half , leaving the edge of the top half about 1/2 '' short of the edge of the bottom half . should you fold the long way , or the short way ? the long way will give you a longer , narrower stollen , with shorter slices ; folding the short way will give you a wider , fatter stollen , with longer slices . use the edge of your hand to press the dough to seal about 1 '' in back of the open edge ; this will make the traditional stollen shape . it 's also the familiar parker house roll shape , if you 've ever made them . place the shaped stollen on the prepared baking sheet . bake the stollen until they 're very lightly browned around the edges , about 40 minutes . a cake tester inserted into the center should come out clean . remove the stollen from the oven , and transfer to a rack . brush them each with 2 to 3 tablespoons melted butter . sprinkle heavily with confectioners ' or non-melting white sugar . allow the stollen to cool , then brush with butter again , and sprinkle with sugar again . wrap in plastic wrap until ready to serve . plastic-wrapped stollen will keep well for 2 weeks or so at room temperature .

tips from our bakers

unlike standard stollen , this version does n't keep for weeks on end . however , it was fresh as fresh could be a week after we made it ; and still good 2 weeks out . by the end of the third week , it was starting to get that dry , stollen-type texture you might be used to ... so we 'd say enjoying it within 2 to 2 1/2 weeks after baking would give you your optimal stollen experience . a number of readers have asked for a substitute for ricotta cheese . you wo n't get as smooth-looking a result using the following substitutions , but the stollen will still be very tasty . reduce the butter to 2 ounces ( 1/4 cup ) . work 3 ounces cream cheese and the butter into the flour as directed . mix the egg and vanilla with a generous 1/3 cup milk ( instead of with ricotta ) . proceed as directed in the recipe .

gluten-free pizza crust

crisp and chewy , this is a wonderful base for your favorite toppings . note : you must use a stand mixer or electric hand mixer to make this dough ; mixing by hand does n't do a thorough enough job .

224 g king arthur gluten-free multi-purpose flour or 6 3/4 ounces brown rice flour blend*
21 g buttermilk powder or nonfat dry milk powder
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon xanthan gum
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 tablespoon sugar or honey ( optional )
227 g warm water
25 g olive oil ( for dough )
25 g olive oil ( for pan )
*see recipe for this blend below .

place the dry ingredients ( except the yeast and sugar or honey , if you 're using it ) into a large mixing bowl ; the bowl of your stand mixer is perfect . mix until thoroughly blended . place the sugar or honey ( if you 're using it ) , warm water , olive oil , yeast , and about 1/2 cup of the dry mixture into a small bowl . stir to combine ; a few lumps are ok. set aside for 30 minutes or so , until the mixture is bubbly and smells yeasty . add this mixture to the dry ingredients , and beat on medium-high speed for 4 minutes . the mixture will be thick and sticky ; if you 've ever applied spackling compound to a wall , that 's exactly what it 'll look and feel like . note : you must use a stand mixer or electric hand mixer to make this dough ; mixing by hand does n't do a thorough enough job . cover the bowl , and let the dough rest for 30 minutes or so . preheat the oven to 425°f . drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil onto the center of a baking sheet or 12 '' round pizza pan . scrape the dough from the bowl onto the puddle of oil . using your wet fingers , start at the center of the dough and work outwards , pressing it into a 12 '' to 14 '' circle . let the dough rest , uncovered , for 15 minutes . bake the crust for 8 to 10 minutes , just until it 's set ; the surface will look opaque , rather than shiny . remove from the oven and top with whatever you like . return to the oven to finish baking , about 10 to 15 minutes depending on the toppings you 've chosen . remove from the oven , and serve warm . yield : one 12 '' to 14 '' pizza . *make your own blend many of our gluten-free recipes use our king arthur gluten-free multi-purpose flour , which includes ingredients that reduce the grittiness sometimes found in gluten-free baked goods . our flour also increases the shelf life of your treats , keeping them fresh longer . the following make-at-home blend , featuring stabilized brown rice flour , works pretty well when substituted ; and it tastes better than a blend using regular brown rice flour . whisk together 6 cups ( 28 1/2 ounces ) king arthur stabilized brown rice flour ; 2 cups ( 10 3/4 ounces ) potato starch ; and 1 cup ( 4 ounces ) tapioca flour or tapioca starch . store airtight at room temperature . note : you can substitute white rice flour for the brown rice flour if you like ; it 'll make your baked goods grittier ( unless you manage to find a finely ground version ) .

tips from our bakers

thin-crust is the way to go with this recipe . since the dough is so soft , it tends to spread and become thinner as it bakes , even if it starts out thicker.to bake your pizza on a pizza or baking stone : place the stone on the center rack of the oven and preheat the oven to 425°f . drizzle 2 tablespoons olive oil onto the center of a half-sheet piece of parchment paper ( about 12 '' x 16 '' ) . scrape the dough from the bowl onto the oil and paper . using wet fingers , press the dough into a 12 '' circle , starting at the center and working out . let the dough rest , uncovered , for 15 minutes . place the crust ( with parchment ) onto the stone , and bake it for 8 to 10 minutes , just until set . remove it from the oven and add toppings . return it to the oven for another 10 to 15 minutes , until the toppings are cooked to the desired doneness .

pain au levain

though it begins with sourdough starter , this lovely bread 's rich flavor is only mildly tangy . with its wonderfully open crumb , it 's great alongside soup , stew , or pasta ; and also makes a delicious sandwich . bonus : this loaf uses no commercially produced yeast , for those of you who enjoy baking with starter alone .

levain

149 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
74 g room-temperature ( 70°f ) water
28 g ripe ( fed ) sourdough starter

dough

631 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
50 g king arthur organic pumpernickel flour or rye flour
482 g water , 75°f to 80°f
1 tablespoon salt

to make the levain : knead together the levain ingredients to make a smooth , stiff dough . place the levain in a lightly oiled bowl , cover it , and allow it to ferment overnight at room temperature ( 65°f to 75°f ) . it should take the levain about 12 hours to mature . the mature levain will have doubled in size and be domed on top , or just beginning to sink in the middle . to make the dough : tear the levain into small pieces and add it to the dough water . add the remaining ingredients and mix until there are no remaining dry pockets of flour . if mixing by hand , use a dough scraper to blend the dough and break down the levain . in a stand mixer , mix the dough on the lowest speed for 2 minutes using the hook attachment . cover the bowl and allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes . knead the dough by hand for 3 minutes , or in a stand mixer for 1 1/2 minutes on speed 2 . the dough will be quite sticky . allow the dough to rise for 60 minutes in an oiled and covered bowl . give the dough a fold and return it to the bowl to rise for another 60 minutes . gently deflate the dough and divide it in half . pre-shape it into two rounds . place the rounds seam side up on a floured surface , covered well . let the rounds relax for 20 minutes . shape the loaves into either a bâtard ( football ) shape or a round ( depending on how you plan to bake it ) . cover the loaves with greased plastic wrap and allow them to rise on lightly greased parchment for approximately 2 hours . loaves can also rise in an oiled dutch oven or cloche ; or seam side up in a well-floured brotform , or a bowl lined with a very well-floured cloth . alternatively , refrigerate the loaves after shaping for up to 16 hours before baking . preheat the oven to 450°f . if you ’ re planning to bake on a stone with steam , preheat the stone and a cast iron frying pan on the shelf below the stone for 60 minutes . score the loaves with one long angled cut down the center of the loaf , and spray or brush them with water . when baking on a stone , slide the parchment and loaf onto the hot stone . pour 1 1/2 cups boiling water into the cast iron frying pan . be sure to wear good oven mitts to prevent a steam burn . if baking in a dutch oven or cloche , remove the lid after 20 minutes and allow the loaf to finish baking in a dry oven . bake the bread for 35 to 40 minutes . the loaves should be a rich brown , firm on the sides , and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom . their internal temperature should be 195°f . remove the loaves from the oven , and cool them on a rack . store at room temperature , lightly wrapped , for a day or so ; freeze for longer storage .

tips from our bakers

check out this helpful video : dividing dough and shaping loaves ; and this blog post : preparing shaped loaves for refrigeration .
if you need to bake one loaf at a time , this dough can handle a staggered bake and shouldn ’ t rise too much , even at room temperature .
9 ” parchment rounds are a great way to help protect your loaves from sticking to your dutch oven or cloche . be sure to oil the sides of the pot as well . when baking in a dutch oven or cloche you can either bake the loaf in the pot in a preheated oven or start baking in a cold oven . remove the lid after 20 minutes when baking in a preheated oven , and 30 minutes when starting in a cold oven . overall baking time will be a bit longer with the cold start ( more like 50 to 60 minutes ) .


six-grain baguettes

with their not-too-tough , crusty exterior and soft , tender interior , these baguettes are a softer , yet tasty , alternative to more traditional baguette recipes . we like them whole for foot-long sandwiches ; ripped into chunks for soaking up a saucy main meal , and/or sliced thin and toasted for a plethora of bruschetta toppings .

170 g lukewarm water
57 g orange juice
1 tablespoon maple syrup
64 g six-grain blend
113 g king arthur white whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast

parker house rolls

these feather-light , buttery rolls were a 19th-century staple of the parker house , a famous boston hotel — the same hotel that in 1855 created the first boston cream pie , serving both rolls and pie to the likes of oliver wendell holmes , henry wadsworth longfellow , and ralph waldo emerson . so what makes a parker house roll special ? butter . a buttery fold during the shaping process ( and butter brushed on after they 're baked ) give them over-the-top flavor . an egg , milk , and a fair amount of butter in the dough give them fine and tender texture . all in all , this boston-based roll is a bread-basket classic . one more note : the `` original '' parker house roll recipe calls for the dough to be cut in circles , dipped in butter , and folded over . however , having tried this rather messy process in the past , and ending up with rolls that popped open in the oven , rather than hold their shape ( and their buttery pocket ) , we opted for a slightly different method . the result ? softly rounded rectangular rolls , looking very much like the rolls served these days at the omni parker house hotel — still a boston landmark after all these years .

in a large mixing bowl , or in the bowl of an electric mixer , combine all of the ingredients ( except the 3 tablespoons melted butter at the end ) , mixing to form a shaggy dough . note : to speed the rising process , whisk together the milk and egg , and heat gently just enough to remove the refrigerator chill ; then add to the remaining ingredients . knead the dough , by hand ( 10 minutes ) or by machine ( 7 to 8 minutes ) until it 's smooth . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or 8-cup measure ( so you can track its rising progress ) . allow it to rise for 90 minutes ; it 'll become quite puffy , though it probably wo n't double in bulk . note that the dough takes quite awhile to get going ; after 1 hour , it may seem like it 's barely expanded at all . but during the last half hour , it rises more quickly . transfer the dough to a lightly greased work surface . divide it in half . working with one half at a time , roll or pat the dough into an 8 '' x 12 '' rectangle . brush the dough all over with a light coating of the melted butter . you 'll have butter left over ; you 'll need it for the other half of the dough , as well as for brushing on top of the baked rolls . cut the dough in half lengthwise , to make two 4 '' x 12 '' rectangles . working with one rectangle at a time , fold it lengthwise to about 1/2 '' of the other edge , so the bottom edge sticks out about 1/2 '' beyond the top edge . you 'll now have a rectangle that 's about 2 1/4 '' x 12 '' . repeat with the other piece of dough . cut each of the rectangles crosswise into four 3 '' pieces , making a total of 8 rolls , each about 2 1/4 '' x 3 '' . place the rolls , smooth side up , in a lightly greased 9 '' x 13 '' pan . repeat with the remaining piece of dough , making 16 rolls in all . you 'll arrange 4 rows of 4 in the pan , with the longer side of the rolls going down the longer side of the pan . gently flatten the rolls to pretty much cover the bottom of the pan . cover the pan , and let the rolls rise for about 45 minutes to 1 hour , until they 're puffy but definitely not doubled . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 350°f . bake the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes , until they 're golden brown and feel set . remove them from the oven , and brush with the remaining melted butter . pull them apart to serve . yield : 16 rolls .

tips from our bakers

due to the natural tendency of yeast dough to both stretch and shrink as you work with it , do n't stress when you do n't end up with rolls that are all the same size . just arrange them however they best fit to cover most of the bottom of the pan — a shorter one next to a longer one , etc . by the time they 've risen , baked , and been slathered with butter , no one will care about perfection , size-wise . and anyway , as ralph waldo emerson said : `` a foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds . ''


cheese pennies

the following recipe is for one of our favorite '50s snacks : cheese pennies , crispy concoction of cheese and butter held together with a bit of flour and baked into golden brown `` pennies . '' these are good served with drinks — non-alcoholic , or otherwise .

227 g grated sharp cheddar cheese
113 g unsalted butter
177 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon dry mustard
1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper ( optional )
paprika ( optional )

in a medium-sized mixing bowl , combine all of the ingredients except the paprika to make a cohesive dough , sprinkling in a tablespoon or so of water if the dough does n't seem to want to come together . as soon as the dough starts to come together , turn off the mixer and gather it into a rough ball . transfer it to a lightly floured work surface , and roll it into a 16 '' log about 1 1/2 '' in diameter . wrap the log in waxed paper or plastic wrap , and chill it in the freezer for 30 minutes . using a serrated knife , slice the log crosswise into 1/8 '' rounds . place them on an ungreased or parchment-lined baking sheet , leaving only about 1/2 '' between them ; they wo n't spread much as they bake . sprinkle them with a bit of paprika , if desired . bake the cheese pennies in a preheated 400°f oven for 11 to 13 minutes , or until they 're just beginning to brown . remove them from the oven , and allow them to cool on the pan for several minutes before transferring them to racks to cool completely . store , well-wrapped , for up a week .

tips from our bakers

these can be made with other cheeses besides cheddar . try crumbled blue , grated parmesan , or even some pepperjack for a bit of a kick.1/8 teaspoon of cayenne pepper is discernible , while 1/4 teaspoon packs a moderate punch . use more if you want a truly eye-watering experience.if you want to freeze the dough for a longer amount of time , just make sure to remove it from the freezer about 30 minutes before you want to slice it .


herb-topped country bread

here 's a hearth loaf that seems to be inspired by japanese gift-wrapping techniques : papers , like those layered with maple leaves and flowers , subtly reveal rather than conceal the gift they enclose . with this loaf , a thin , almost translucent , gift-wrap of dough just reveals the herbs below the surface .

sponge

170 g cool water
120 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
28 g pumpernickel flour
1/8 teaspoon instant yeast

dough

227 g warm water ( 95 to 110°f )
1 teaspoon instant yeast
482 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
25 g olive oil
1 3/4 teaspoons salt

topping

1/2 cup fresh , whole herbs ( basil , parsley , rosemary , or a mixture of herbs of your choice )
2 teaspoons coarse salt or flavored salt

to make the sponge : in a small bowl , mix together the sponge ingredients . cover the bowl with plastic wrap and leave it at cool room temperature for at least 4 hours , and up to about 18 hours ( longer than that , you 'll need to refrigerate it ) . as you can see , it 's often convenient to make this sponge the night before baking . combine the sponge and all of the dough ingredients — by hand , mixer , or bread machine — kneading to form a smooth and elastic dough . ( if kneading by hand , reserve 1/2 cup of flour from the dough for use while kneading . ) transfer the dough to a large , lightly greased bowl or dough-rising bucket , cover the bowl or bucket , and allow the dough to rise for 1 to 2 hours , or until it 's doubled in size . once the dough has risen , transfer it to a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface , and divide it into two pieces ( about 15 ounces each ) . remove a golf ball-sized nub of dough from each piece . ( each of these little dough balls will weigh about 2 1/2 ounces , 71g . ) shape the two larger pieces of dough into round loaves , place them on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet , cover them , and set them aside to rise while you make your `` wrapping paper . '' ( if you have a baking stone , shape the loaves and set them on a piece of parchment paper ; this will make it easy to slide them into the oven and onto the stone , paper and all . ) very lightly grease or flour your work surface . roll out each small piece of dough as thinly as you can into a circle that will cover the loaves . this may take a bit of stretching , alternating with resting , to get the dough to relax enough to be rolled to a thickness of about 1/16 '' . spritz or brush water over the top of each loaf . place herbs ( whole basil leaves , sprigs of parsley or rosemary , etc . ) all over the surface . remember that the loaf will expand in the oven , so crowd on quite a few leaves ! spritz with water again . place one of the thin sheets of dough over a loaf , and gently smooth it down with your hands . tuck and stretch the edges of the `` wrap '' under the loaf to seal your `` package . '' if any large air bubbles appear , use a pin to pop the bubble , then press to smooth and seal the dough with your finger . spritz the loaf very lightly with water , and sprinkle it with about 1 teaspoon of coarse or flavored salt , as well as a few more herbs . prepare the second loaf using the same technique . let the loaves rise , covered , until they 've almost doubled . about a half hour before they 're fully risen , place your baking stone ( if you 're using one ) in your oven , and preheat the oven to 450°f . just before placing your loaves in the oven , spray them heavily with water until the surface of the dough is wet . using a peel , slide the loaves onto the baking stone . if you 're not using a stone , place the pan in the oven on a middle rack . bake the loaves for 20 to 25 minutes , until they 're golden brown and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a loaf registers 190°f . remove the loaves from the oven , and cool them on a wire rack . for extra-crisp loaves , turn the oven off , crack the door open about 1 inch , and allow the loaves to cool in the turned-off oven . store , wrapped , for 3 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to a month .

english muffin toasting bread

this yeasty , coarse-textured bread makes the best toast ever , a perfect partner to fresh summer jam or preserves . a purely mix-it-slap-in-the-pan-bake-and-eat-it loaf , it 's earned a place of honor in our king arthur test kitchen hall of fame .

361 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
14 g sugar
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon instant yeast
227 g milk
57 g water
25 g vegetable oil or olive oil
cornmeal , to sprinkle in pan

whisk together the flour , sugar , salt , baking soda , and instant yeast in a large mixing bowl , or the bowl of a stand mixer . combine the milk , water , and oil in a separate , microwave-safe bowl , and heat to between 120°f and 130°f . be sure to stir the liquid well before measuring its temperature ; you want an accurate reading . if you do n't have a thermometer , the liquid will feel quite hot ( hotter than lukewarm ) , but not so hot that it would be uncomfortable as bath water . pour the hot liquid over the dry ingredients in the mixing bowl . using an electric beater , or stand mixer with beater attachment , beat at high speed for 1 minute ; the dough will be smooth and very soft . if you do n't have an electric mixer , beat by hand for 2 to 3 minutes , or until the dough is smooth and starting to become elastic . lightly grease an 8 1/2 '' x 4 1/2 '' loaf pan , and sprinkle the bottom and sides with cornmeal . scoop the soft dough into the pan , leveling it in the pan as much as possible . cover the pan , and let the dough rise till it 's just barely crowned over the rim of the pan . when you look at the rim of the pan from eye level , you should see the dough , but it should n't be more than , say , 1/4 '' over the rim . this will take about 45 minutes to 1 hour , if you heated the liquid to the correct temperature and your kitchen is n't very cold . while the dough is rising , preheat the oven to 400°f . remove the cover , and bake the bread for 22 to 27 minutes , till it 's golden brown and its interior temperature is 190°f . remove the bread from the oven , and after 5 minutes turn it out of the pan onto a rack to cool . let the bread cool completely before slicing .




swedish holiday saffron buns

these bright-gold buns celebrate sweden 's christmastime feast of st. lucia on december 13 . they 're easy to make , fun to shape , and make a pretty statement in your holiday dinner breadbasket . or serve them for breakfast , with butter or devon cream .

buns

57 g hot water
1/4 teaspoon crushed saffron threads
113 g milk
50 g sugar
43 g butter
1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 large egg
1 large egg yolk ( reserve the white for the topping )
1 tablespoon instant yeast
361 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour

topping

1 egg white ( reserved from above ) , whisked with 14 g water
57 g pearl sugar or sparkling white sugar , optional
golden raisins , optional

combine the hot water and saffron , and let sit for 10 minutes to soften the saffron . mix and knead together — by hand , mixer , or bread machine — the saffron water , milk , sugar , butter , salt , egg , egg yolk , yeast , and flour to make a soft , elastic dough . set the dough aside to rise until puffy ( but not necessarily doubled in bulk ) , about 60 to 90 minutes . at this point , you can place the covered bowl in the refrigerator , and chill the dough overnight . it 'll continue to rise in the fridge , but much more slowly . gently deflate the dough , and divide it into 12 pieces . gently shape and roll each piece between your hands to form short logs , about 4 '' long . let them rest , covered , for 15 minutes . lightly grease a baking sheet , or line it with parchment . roll each log into a 15 '' rope ; they 'll fight back and shrink to about 12 '' ; that 's ok . shape each into an s , with the ends tucked in nicely . or shape into a figure-8 by making a loop , pinching and rolling the ends together , and making an 8 . lay the buns on the prepared pan . cover with lightly greased plastic wrap or the cover of your choice , and let rise for about 1 hour , or until they 're puffy ; dough that 's been refrigerated will probably need to rise for about 90 minutes . towards the end of the rising time , preheat your oven to 350°f . brush the buns with the beaten egg white . sprinkle them with pearl or coarse sugar , if desired . we like bright-white pearl sugar , as it contrasts so nicely with the buns ' golden color . bake the buns for 20 minutes , or until they 're set and light golden brown . remove them from the oven , and tuck a couple of golden raisins into the center of the 8 's , or the end loops of the s 's , if desired . serve warm or at room temperature ; a dab of butter or devon cream is always nice . store , well-wrapped , for 2 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to a month .




irish soda bread

the `` real '' irish soda bread consists simply of irish wholemeal flour ( equivalent to a coarse grind of our american whole wheat flour ) , baking soda , salt and buttermilk . at the other end of the spectrum is americanized irish soda bread , a white , sweet , cake-like confection filled with raisins or currants and caraway seeds . the version we print here is much closer to traditional irish bread than to its american cousin ; but the addition of some bread flour , an egg , butter , a bit of sugar , and some currants serve to lighten and tenderize this loaf just enough to make it attractive to most of us on this side of the ocean .

283 g king arthur 100 % white whole wheat flour or 276 g king arthur irish-style wholemeal flour
149 g king arthur unbleached bread flour
35 g sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda
3/4 teaspoon salt
99 g currants or raisins
57 g cold butter , cut into 8 pieces
301 g buttermilk
1 large egg
28 g melted butter , optional

preheat the oven to 400°f . lightly grease an 8 '' or 9 '' round cake pan . in a medium-sized mixing bowl , whisk together the flours , sugar , baking soda , salt , and currants or raisins . using a mixer , a pastry fork or blender , or your fingers , work in the butter until it 's evenly distributed and no large chunks remain . in a separate bowl ( or in a measuring cup ) whisk together the buttermilk and egg . pour this mixture into the dry ingredients and mix to combine . the dough will be stiff ; if it 's too crumbly to squeeze together , add another tablespoon or two of buttermilk . knead the dough a couple of times to make sure it 's holding together , then shape it into a ball . flatten the ball slightly , and place the loaf in your pan . use a sharp knife to cut a 1/2 '' -deep cross in the loaf . bake the bread for about 45 to 55 minutes , until it 's golden brown and a cake tester or toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean . remove the bread from the oven and brush the top with melted butter , if desired . store for about 2 days , well wrapped , at room temperature ; freeze for longer storage ( up to about a month ) .

tips from our bakers

for a more authentic soda bread , use king arthur irish-style wholemeal flour rather than white whole wheat flour.the craggy crust on this hearty , dense bread makes it somewhat tough to cut in thin slices ; we suggest using a serrated knife to cut wedge-shaped pieces . a bit of butter or jam is a nice addition .

honey curry pita with curried chicken salad

sweet honey and savory curry powder blend in the pita dough to create a compelling combination of flavors , delicious with a curried chicken salad .

honey curry pita

454 g warm water
85 g to 128 g honey
2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast or instant yeast
659 g to 773 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
25 g to 50 g vegetable oil , optional but will help the pitas stay fresh
2 to 3 teaspoons curry powder
14 g salt
cornmeal , for baking sheets

curried chicken salad

454 g to 567 g chicken , cut in bite-sized pieces , cooked quickly in a skillet and chilled
71 g chopped onions or 32 g scallions
71 g chopped celery
57 g chopped walnuts
170 g seedless grapes , halved ( scissors will do this quickly )
227 g mayonnaise
7 g fresh parsley , minced
1/2 to 1 teaspoon curry powder ( start with the lesser amount and add to taste )

to make the pita : pour the water into a mixing bowl . stir in the honey , yeast and about 2 cups of flour . set it aside and allow to work for about 15 minutes . when the mixture has expanded , mix in the oil , curry powder , salt and a further 3 1/2 cups of flour . stir this together as well as you can in the bowl and then turn out onto a kneading surface where you 've sprinkled the remainder of the flour . knead the dough , adding enough more flour to keep it from sticking to you or the board , until it has really come together , about 2 or 3 minutes . then give it a rest while you clean out and grease the bowl . after this little rest , the flour will have better absorbed the moisture , the developing gluten will have relaxed , the dough will feel less lumpy and more cohesive . continue kneading until it 's springy and smooth . shape the dough into a ball , place it in the greased bowl and turn it over so that the top has a thin film of grease on it . cover the bowl with a damp towel or plastic wrap and let the yeast go to work . while the yeast is busy , you can make fillings to go in the pitas when they 're done . after the dough has doubled in bulk ( when you can poke a finger in it and it does n't bounce back at you ) , begin preheating your oven to a hot 500°f . knock the dough down , knead out any stray bubbles and divide it into 8 ( or 4 if you 've made only half the recipe ) pieces . on a lightly floured surface , roll each out into a circle about 7 '' in diameter . place two each on a cornmeal sprinkled baking sheet , cover with a damp cloth and let rest for at least 15 minutes . after the circles have rested , place the baking sheet on the oven bottom ( if you have a baking stone , place it on that ) , close the oven door and keep it shut for 2 minutes . it 's this initial intense heat that begins to create the pocket . the outside of the dough bakes very quickly while the carbon dioxide bubbles inside expand and separate the top layer of the dough from the bottom . after the initial 2 minutes , place the baking sheet on a rack higher up in the oven and continue baking for another 5 to 6 minutes . during this part of the baking process , the pitas should blow up like balloons . when they are done , remove the sheet from the oven and slide the pitas onto a cooling rack . as the gas inside them cools , they will deflate somewhat . once they are completely cool , you can press the balance of the gas out of them so you can slide them into an airtight bag until they 're ready to be cut in half and filled . to make the chicken salad : in a mixing bowl , stir together the chicken , onion , celery , walnuts and grapes . in a smaller bowl , blend together the mayonnaise , parsley and curry powder . when you 're happy with the combination of flavors , stir gently into the chicken mixture . serve in the honey curry pita with lettuce . store chicken salad in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week .

tips from our bakers

the suggested amounts for the honey and curry powder in the pita are fairly wide since you can make these flavors subtle or strong depending on taste .

1 1/4 teaspoons salt
1 tablespoon instant yeast
3 large eggs + 1 large egg yolk , white reserved for topping
57 g lukewarm water
142 g butter

pastry cream filling

680 g whole milk
131 g granulated sugar
1/4 teaspoon salt
35 g cornstarch
1 tablespoon king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
4 large egg yolks
2 teaspoons vanilla extract or vanilla bean crush
57 g butter
113 g heavy cream , whipped to soft peaks

brioche topping

1 large egg white lightly beaten with 1 tablespoon cold water
coarse white sparkling sugar or swedish pearl sugar

in a stand mixer or bread machine ( programmed for dough ) , mix together all of the dough ingredients to form a smooth , shiny dough . do n't worry ; what starts out as a sticky mess becomes beautifully satiny as it kneads . this dough takes longer than most to develop , so be prepared to let the dough knead for up to 15 to 20 minutes in a stand mixer . also , we do n't recommend trying to knead it by hand . if you 're using a bread machine , let it complete its kneading cycle , then continue as directed below . form the dough into a ball ( it 'll be very soft ) , place it in a greased bowl , cover the bowl , and it let rise for 1 hour . refrigerate the dough for several hours , or overnight . this will slow the fermentation and chill the butter , making the dough easier to shape . while the dough is chilling , prepare the pastry cream . in a medium-sized saucepan , stir together 2 1/2 cups of the milk , the sugar , and the salt . bring to a simmer over medium heat , stirring to dissolve the sugar . meanwhile , whisk the cornstarch , flour , and egg yolks with the remaining 1/2 cup milk . whisk about 1/3 cup of the hot milk mixture with the egg yolks . this keeps the yolks from turning to scrambled eggs when you add them to the simmering milk . pour the egg/milk mixture back into the remaining simmering milk . doing this through a strainer will help prevent lumps later . bring to a boil , stirring constantly with a whisk , until the mixture thickens . to avoid lumps , it 's important to stir this constantly , and to run a spatula along the bottom of the pan to make sure nothing 's sticking . do n't worry , the cream wo n't take long to thicken . remove the pastry cream from the heat and pour it through a sieve to remove any lumps . stir in the butter and vanilla extract . transfer the pastry cream to a storage bowl , and top with a buttered piece of parchment or plastic wrap . this will prevent a skin from forming . refrigerate the cream until you 're ready to use it . to shape and bake the brioche : remove the brioche dough from the refrigerator , and divide it into 16 pieces . shape each piece into a round ball . space the balls on a lightly greased or parchment-lined baking sheet , leaving about 2 '' between them ; they 'll expand quite a bit . cover the brioche , and let them rise for 2 1/2 to 3 hours , until they 're very puffy . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 375°f . brush each brioche with some of the egg wash , and sprinkle with coarse white sparkling sugar or swedish pearl sugar . place the pan on a lower-middle rack in the oven , and bake the brioche for 25 to 30 minutes , tenting them with aluminum foil after 15 minutes if they appear to be browning too quickly . the finished brioche will register at least 190°f on an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center . remove the brioche from the oven , and cool on a rack . finish the pastry cream by whipping the 1/2 cup heavy cream to soft peaks , and folding it into the refrigerated pastry cream . slit each brioche around the circumference , making a top and bottom . spoon a heaping 1/4 cup filling onto the bottom , and lay the top over the filling . serve within an hour or so . brioche can be filled and refrigerated for several hours , covered . allow them to warm a bit before serving . yield : 16 filled brioche .

food processor french-style bread

when the weather is hot , no one wants to stay in the kitchen long . however , those of us who truly enjoy baking bread want our own creations all year long . we soon learn that we must work faster during the summer months , leaving the rest of the year for the more involved recipes with longer , slower rising times . this french-style bread is made in the food processor for speed , but can be made by hand . it 's shaped into baguettes , which bake much faster than regular loaves of bread . it 's a basic loaf which lends itself to variations . use your imagination ; if an idea sounds good , try it ! we 've listed some ideas in our `` tips '' section below .

14 g active dry yeast or instant yeast
113 g lukewarm water ( 110°f to 115°f )
1 teaspoon sugar
723 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons salt
454 g 90°f water
1 large egg beaten with 14 g cold water , for glaze
note : make sure your food processor will accommodate the amount of flour in the recipe . if it does n't , cut the recipe in half .

combine the yeast , 1/2 cup warm water , and sugar in a measuring cup . let it sit for 5 minutes , until bubbles appear . put all of the flour and salt into the work bowl of a food processor . using the plastic ( dough ) blade , pulse four times to lighten and mix . with the machine running , add the yeast mixture , then 90°f water as fast as the flour will absorb it . stop the machine as soon as all the liquid has been added . check the dough by pulsing it 7 or 8 times . it should pull together to form a ball . watch the processor bowl where the side meets the bottom ; if there are still bits of unincorporated flour , the dough is too dry . pulse in water 1 tablespoon at a time , until the dough pulls together to form a ball . if the dough clings to the sides of the bowl , it 's too wet ; gradually add more flour while pulsing . the formation of the ball marks the beginning of the kneading process . turn the machine on and let `` knead '' for 60 seconds — do n't let it knead any longer ! if you have to use a metal blade , only `` knead '' 45 seconds and finish kneading by hand for 3 to 4 minutes . place the dough in an oiled bowl , turning to grease the top of the dough . cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let rise until puffy , about 1 hour . divide the dough into four pieces . roll each piece into an oval about 15 '' x 8 '' . starting on the long side , roll the dough into a 15 '' cylinder . pinch the edges to the body of dough , tapering the ends evenly . place the dough seam-side down into well-greased baguette pans or onto parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheets , leaving about 4 '' between the loaves . cover the loaves with a piece of greased plastic wrap , and let rise until puffy , about 45 minutes . while the bread is rising , preheat the oven to 425°f . place a shallow metal pan on the bottom shelf of the oven . just before baking , slash the loaves diagonally with a sharp blade , about 1/4 '' deep . brush lightly with egg glaze . place the loaves into the oven , and add 1 cup of ice cubes to the pan on the bottom . close the door quickly to preserve the steam . bake the bread for 20 minutes , or until its internal temperature reaches 190°f . the loaves should be golden brown all around , smell fragrant , and feel lighter when picked up . remove the loaves from the oven , and transfer them to a rack to cool . store the bread at room temperature for 2 days in plastic ; or wrap and freeze for up to 3 months .

tips from our bakers

you might try adding 3 tablespoons of chopped fresh herbs , or chopped sun-dried tomatoes and olives ( either green or black or a combination of both for interesting color ) , or 1 cup of shredded parmesan . add any of these with the flour . you can also substitute 2 cups of another type of flour for an equal amount of the unbleached flour — whole wheat or rye are great . understand the loaves will be denser and heavier than those made with 100 % all-purpose flour.you can omit the egg wash if you 'd prefer the rustic , floury look in the photo . after the loaves are shaped , gently roll them in flour , then then let them rise and bake as directed .


no-knead amaranth honey-nut bread

sweet , nutty , and earthy in flavor , and soft and moist yet crusty in texture , this bread hits all the right buttons when it comes to a hearty loaf . the honey both sweetens and helps to develop the crust 's deep-dark brown color ; while the amaranth and nuts , along with the dough 's long , slow rise , enhance the finished loaf 's complex flavor .

397 g room-temperature water ( about 75°f )
85 g honey
50 g vegetable oil
447 g high-gluten flour or king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
103 g amaranth flour
2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon instant yeast
170 g chopped walnuts

mix together the water , honey , oil , flours , salt , and yeast in a large bowl . stir , then use your hands ( or a stand mixer ) to mix and form a sticky dough . work the dough just enough to incorporate all the flour ( or mix for several minutes in a stand mixer ) , then work in the nuts . cover the bowl and let the dough rest at room temperature overnight , or for at least 8 hours ; it 'll become bubbly and rise quite a bit , so use a large bowl . next day , lightly grease a 4-quart round lidded baking crock or dutch oven . turn the dough out onto a floured work surface , and form it into a round loaf to fit your pan . place the loaf in the pan , smooth side up . cover the pan with its lid , and let the loaf rise at room temperature for about 1 hour , until the dough has become puffy and fills the pan about 3/4 full . place the pan ( with its lid ) into a cold oven , and set the oven temperature to 450°f . bake the bread for 45 to 55 minutes , then remove the lid and continue to bake for another 5 to 10 minutes , until the bread is deep brown and a digital thermometer inserted into the center registers about 205°f . remove the bread from the oven , turn it out onto a rack , and allow it to cool before slicing .

for a denser , omega-3-packed loaf , add 1/4 cup golden flax meal and 1/4 cup chia seeds .


chocolate monkey bread

we 've never been partial to chocolate bread ; somehow , this cross between cake and white bread seems to fall short on both counts . but coat vanilla-scented white bread with a ground chocolate/sugar/cocoa combo , and you 've got another animal entirely . the bread retains its soft , faintly sweet character . and the chocolate , rather than coming across as dull or bitter as it so often does in chocolate bread , fairly sings in concert with its soft , yeasty partner .

filling

85 g semisweet chocolate , chopped , or chocolate chips
67 g sugar
21 g dutch-process cocoa
14 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour

dough

semolina black olive bread boats

these are bâtard-like ovals with somewhat pointed ends , a shallow , long container rather than one that 's round and deep . this shape is perfect for filling with salad ( rather than soup or stew ) . there 's lots of crust to soak up the salad dressing , and you get a piece of bread in just about every bite .

dough

489 g semolina flour ( see `` tips '' , below . )
397 g lukewarm water
120 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour ( see `` tips '' , below . )
25 g olive oil
2 teaspoons instant yeast
2 teaspoons salt
71 g to 85 g black kalamata olives , pitted and chopped

dressing

1 clove garlic , peeled and minced
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon ground black pepper
28 g fresh lemon juice
14 g red wine vinegar
67 g olive oil

salad

454 g mixed salad greens
227 g to 284 g ripe tomatoes
85 g to 113 g cucumber , peeled and diced
71 g sweet or red onion , peeled and diced
85 g crumbled feta cheese

to make the dough manually or with a mixer : place the semolina flour ( or the first portion of all-purpose flour ) into a large bowl or the bowl of an electric mixer and stir in the warm water . let the mixture sit for 20 minutes or so . this will allow the semolina to absorb the water , and make the kneading easier . add the remaining ingredients , except the black olives . knead the mixture to form a smooth , elastic dough , adding additional water or flour as necessary . pat the kneaded dough into a rectangle , and sprinkle it with the olives . fold the dough over a few a times and knead it for a minute or two to incorporate the olives . place the dough in an oiled bowl , turn to coat , then cover the bowl and let the dough rise for 1 1/2 hours , or until it 's very puffy . to make the dough using a bread machine : place all of the dough ingredients except the olives into the pan of your bread machine , program the machine for manual or dough , and press start . check the dough about 10 minutes before the end of the final kneading cycle , and adjust its consistency as necessary with additional flour or water . it should be smooth and elastic . add the olives when about 5 minutes remain in the final kneading cycle . allow the machine to complete its cycle . to shape the dough : turn the dough out onto a lightly greased work surface and fold it over a few times to release the excess gas . divide the dough into six pieces , each will be about the size of a large handball . round each piece into a ball , cover them lightly , and let them rest for a few minutes . flatten each ball into a 5 '' -circle . fold the circle as if you were folding a letter ( one side into the center , the opposite side into the center and over the first side ) . turn the dough over so the edges are underneath , and press to seal . cup your hands around each piece and roll them gently into ovals with pointed ends . flatten each one to widen the center . place the boats on a parchment-lined baking sheet , cover them with lightly greased plastic wrap or a proof cover , and let them rise until puffy . this will take 45 minutes to an hour , possibly longer , depending on the warmth of your kitchen . to bake the loaves : toward the end of the rise , preheat the oven to 400°f . spritz the risen loaves with warm water , and slash them lengthwise down the middle . bake them for 20 to 24 minutes , until they 're a light golden brown . remove the boats from the oven , and allow them to cool for an hour or longer before putting the filling inside and serving them . to assemble and serve the boats with salad : cut the tops off the boats , and hollow out the insides . ( reserve the bread for bread crumbs or bread salad . ) whisk together all of the dressing ingredients . toss the salad ingredients with the dressing and evenly distribute it among the bread boats . serve immediately . store the unfilled bread boats , well-wrapped at room temperature for up to 3 days . store the salad , covered in the fridge for up to 3 days .

tips from our bakers

if you want very crisp boats , place them into a hot ( 400°f ) oven for 10 to 12 minutes to toast before filling . let them cool a bit before serving . if you do n't have semolina flour , use 4 3/4 cups ( 20 ounces , 567g ) king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour for the total flour in the recipe .

more grated cheese to garnish the top

to make the polenta : in a medium saucepan , combine the cornmeal and cold water , stirring until the cornmeal is evenly moistened . stir in the milk and salt , and place the pan over medium-high heat . cook , stirring frequently , until the mixture thickens and bubbles . continue cooking for 5 to 7 minutes more , until the mixture pulls away from the sides of the pan . remove from the heat and set aside to cool to lukewarm . to make the dough : in the bowl of your mixer combine the cooled polenta , water , yeast and olive oil , stirring until the mixture is smooth . add the flour , cheese , and parsley , and mix until a soft dough forms . you can also combine the ingredients in the order listed above in the pan of your bread machine set on the dough cycle . press start and let the machine complete the cycle , checking the dough 's consistency after 2 minutes of kneading time , adding a tablespoon more flour or water if necessary to adjust it . knead the dough for 6 to 8 minutes , until it 's smooth and springy . place the dough in a greased bowl , cover with greased plastic wrap , and let rise until doubled , about 45 minutes . after the dough has risen , deflate it and divide it in thirds . roll each piece to a rope about 10 inches long . braid the dough , pinching the ends together to seal them and tucking them under the loaf . place the braid in a lightly greased 9 '' x 5 '' loaf pan . cover with lightly greased plastic wrap or a large inverted bowl , and let rise until the dough is an inch above the rim of the pan ; about 30 to 45 minutes , depending on the warmth of the room . after 20 minutes of rising time , preheat the oven to 375°f . when the loaf is ready to bake , remove the covering and sprinkle the top with more grated asiago cheese . bake for 25 to 30 minutes , until the center measures 190°f when measured with an instant-read thermometer . remove the bread fro the oven and place the pan on a rack to cool for 15 minutes . after 15 minutes , turn the read out of the pan and return it to the rack to finish cooling completely before slicing .

tips from our bakers

traditionally , dry polenta is sprinkled into simmering liquid , while whisking constantly . while effective , the technique requires some dexterity to avoid making lumps . a more surefire way to make smooth polenta is to wet the cornmeal with some of the recipe 's cold liquid before proceeding .

tips from our bakers

it 's often difficult to be sure gluten-free quick breads are fully baked in the middle . a cake tester inserted into the center may come out crumb and batter free before the bread is fully baked ; thus , using an instant-read thermometer is a good idea.to make this bread using coconut flour : reduce the gluten-free flour to 1 1/2 cups ; and add 1/2 cup coconut flour along with the flax . reduce the vegetable oil to 1/4 cup ; and substitute 1 teaspoon vanilla extract for the 1/2 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 teaspoon banana flavor . bake the bread for 55 to 60 minutes , until its internal temperature reaches at least 200°f .

tips from our bakers

if you do n't cut the unbaked rolls deeply enough , the shape disappears as they bake ; if you cut too deeply ( all the way through ) , the rolls will form `` petals '' as they rise and look like a daisy , not a kaiser roll.note that the simplest way to give these rolls their traditional shape is with a kaiser roll stamp . if you do n't have a stamp , check out our blog post on how to shape kaiser rolls .

flour is like a sponge ; it can absorb moisture from the atmosphere , so the amount of water you use can vary depending on climate and season . use the lesser amount of water in the summer , or under humid conditions ; the greater amount in winter , or when the climate is dry.for added whole-grain goodness , substitute king arthur white whole wheat flour for up to half of the all-purpose flour in this recipe.want to keep your bread fresher longer ? try the tangzhong technique , a japanese method for increasing the softness and shelf life of yeast bread and rolls . begin by measuring out the flour and water you ’ ll be using in the recipe , going with the greater amount of water ( 2/3 cup ) . now take 3 tablespoons of the measured flour and 1/2 cup of the measured water ; put them in a saucepan set over medium-high heat . cook the mixture , whisking constantly , until it thickens and forms a thick slurry ; this will take about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes . transfer the cooked mixture to a bowl , let it cool to lukewarm , then combine it with the remaining flour , water , and other dough ingredients . proceed with the recipe as directed . well-wrapped and stored at room temperature , your finished bread should stay soft and fresh for up to a week .

to make the dough : in a large mixing bowl , the bowl of an electric mixer , or your bread machine , combine all of the dry ingredients , then mix in the peanut butter ; the mixture will be crumbly , like pie crust dough before you add the water . in a separate bowl , beat the egg and water together , then pour it into the flour mixture . mix and knead the dough — by hand , machine , or bread machine — until it becomes shiny and elastic . put the dough into a greased bowl , turn to coat , cover the bowl , and allow to rise for about 1 to 2 hours , or until it 's not quite doubled in size . to make the filling : combine the jelly and instant clearjel , mixing until smooth . you can leave out the clearjel , but the jelly is much more likely to seep out of the rolls if you do . in a separate bowl , combine the peanut butter and honey , mixing until smooth . set both fillings aside . line two baking sheets with parchment paper . to assemble the rolls : turn the risen dough out onto a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface . divide the dough into 16 ping-pong ball-sized pieces , about 2 to 2 1/2 ounces each ( 54g to 68g ) , and roll them into balls . flatten each ball into a 4 '' round . drop 1 1/2 teaspoonfuls each of the peanut butter filling and jelly filling onto the center of each round . fold the edges of the rounds over the filling to create half-moon shapes , and crimp to seal . place the rolls on the baking sheets . cover them and let them rise for 1 to 2 hours , or until they 're puffy but not doubled in size . while the rolls are rising , preheat the oven to 375°f . bake the rolls for 12 to 15 minutes , until they 're golden brown . remove them from the oven , and let them cool a bit before glazing . to make the glaze : melt the butter with the honey in a small saucepan set over low heat , or in the microwave . lightly brush the glaze over the rolls while they 're still warm . caution : let the rolls cool for at least 30 minutes before serving — the peanut butter and jelly will be hot ! store , wrapped , for 2 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to 3 months .

merlin 's magic sourdough bread

this finely textured bread will stay fresh longer than most loaves you 'll make , due to both the olive oil and the sourdough starter : breads higher in acid retain moisture better than less acidic loaves .

the day before : mix together the starter , water , and yeast . add 3 cups ( 12 3/4 ounces ) of the flour . cover with a damp towel , and let this sponge sit overnight . at this point , you may let the sponge sit for as long as 24 hours ; the longer it rests , the more flavorful your bread will be . the next day : add the salt , oil , and enough of the remaining flour ( up to 10 1/2 ounces ) to make a soft dough that cleans the sides of the bowl . turn the dough out onto a lightly floured or oiled work surface , and knead it , adding more flour as necessary , until it 's smooth and springs back when you poke it . if the dough feels too stiff , add a few more teaspoons of water to soften it . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl , cover it with lightly greased plastic wrap , and let it rise for 2 hours . the dough should become puffy . again , you may let the dough rise for as long as 12 hours at this point ; to prevent the bread from over-proofing and thus losing strength to rise again in the oven , slow the fermentation by letting the dough rise in a cooler place , like your refrigerator . press the dough down and divide it into two pieces . form each piece into a round ball , and place each ball on a baking sheet that has been greased and sprinkled with cornmeal . cover the loaves with damp towels or lightly greased plastic wrap , and allow them to rise for 1 hour ( or more ) , or until they 've become puffy and a pressed finger leaves a mark . while the loaves are rising , preheat the oven to 375°f . use a sharp knife or lame to make three slashes on the top of each loaf , which helps the bread to rise evenly in the oven . bake for about 35 minutes , or until the bread is golden , sounds hollow when tapped , and the internal temperature of the loaf is 190°f to 205°f on a digital thermometer . remove the bread from the oven , and cool completely on a rack . store loosely wrapped in plastic for 3 days , or wrap tightly and freeze for up to 3 months .

dumplings

213 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
57 g ( 1/2 stick ) butter
1/4 cup chopped fresh herbs ( chives , parsley ) , or 2 tablespoons dried ( optional )
170 g buttermilk
1 large egg

pot pie filling

57 g ( 1/2 stick ) butter
57 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
680 g turkey stock , or a combination of stock and leftover gravy
1 teaspoon dry thyme
1 bay leaf
salt and pepper to taste
1/4 teaspoon worcestershire sauce
4 cups diced cooked turkey or chicken
340 g frozen mixed vegetables

to make the dumplings : whisk together the flour , baking soda , baking powder , and salt . cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse bread crumbs . stir in the herbs , if using . cover and refrigerate this mixture while you 're making the pot pie filling . to make the filling : melt the butter in a 3-quart saucepan over medium heat . whisk in the flour and cook for 1 minute . add the stock 1/2 cup at a time , whisking it into the roux to prevent lumps . when all the stock and/or gravy is added , season with the thyme , bay leaf , salt , pepper and worcestershire sauce . simmer the sauce for 15 minutes , then stir in the meat and vegetables . return the filling to a simmer , and transfer to a 4-quart baking dish with a lid . preheat the oven to 350°f . to assemble : once the hot filling is in the dish , whisk the buttermilk and egg together , and add , all at once , to the dry mixture . stir together until evenly moistened . scoop the batter on top of the simmering liquid , leaving space between the dumplings ( they 'll almost double as they cook ) . make dumplings large or small , according to your own preference ; we like to top the filling with about 8 to 10 dumplings . put the lid on top , and bake at 350°f for 25 to 30 minutes .

tips from our bakers

if you do n't have buttermilk on hand for the dumplings , you could thin 1/2 cup sour cream with 1/4 cup milk . plain yogurt would also work as a substitute.you can make the pot pie filling in advance , as well as the dumpling recipe ( stop before adding the buttermilk and egg ) . when you 're ready to cook , preheat the oven while you bring the filling to a simmer . mix the buttermilk and egg into the dumpling mix , scoop , and bake.this is a good recipe for using odds and ends of vegetables , if you have them : gather any stray mushrooms , onions , carrots and leeks you have in the refrigerator , and saute them until tender before adding them to the sauce.the steam from the sauce helps to keep the dumplings tender , so try not to peek at them while they 're cooking , at least for the first 20 minutes . your patience will be rewarded with lighter , fluffier dumplings.do n't mix the dry dumpling mix with the wet ingredients until you 're ready to put the casserole in the oven . if you let the mixture sit too long before baking it , its baking powder will lose some of its rise while waiting .

bialys

if you 're from new york city , you 're no doubt shaking your head and muttering to yourself , `` those are n't bialys ! '' indeed , they 're not ; while classic nyc bialys have a mere trace of chopped onion and poppy seed at their centers , these are much more generously endowed — with onion alone , no poppy seed . heresy ? perhaps . but we think their classic flat shape and chewy texture help make up for the overabundance of fried onions — if such a thing is even possible ! read our blog about these bialys , with additional photos , at flourish .

crust

241 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
1 1/4 teaspoons instant yeast
3/4 teaspoon salt
14 g olive oil
113 g to 170 g lukewarm water*

filling

907 g eggplant , cut in 1/2 '' slices ; peeled or not , your choice
28 g milk
1 large egg
85 g to 99 g panko or other coarse bread crumbs
pizza , marinara , or spaghetti sauce
227 g shredded or grated mozzarella cheese , or a combination of your favorite pizza cheeses

to make the crust : combine all of the ingredients in a bowl , and mix and knead — using your hands , a mixer , or a bread machine set on the dough setting — to make a soft , smooth dough . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or other rising container ( an 8-cup measure works well ) , cover it , and let it rise until it 's just about doubled in bulk , about 1 1/2 to 2 hours . while the dough is rising , prepare the eggplant . lightly grease two large baking sheets . preheat the oven to 400°f . slice eggplants about 3/8 '' thick . whisk together the egg and milk . pour the bread crumbs into a shallow dish . dip each eggplant slice into the egg/milk mixture , and let it drain . then dip both sides into the bread crumbs . lay the slices in a single layer in the prepared pans . drizzle or spray with olive oil , and season with salt . bake the eggplant for 40 minutes , or until it 's soft and the crumbs are beginning to brown . remove it from the oven , and let it cool right on the pan . gently deflate the risen dough , and turn it out onto a clean work surface . divide it in half . working with one half at a time , place the dough onto a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet . pat it into an 11 '' to 12 '' circle . brush the dough with sauce , leaving 1/2 '' clean all around the edges . use as much sauce as you like ; some prefer just a touch of the red , others like a significant amount . arrange half the eggplant , slightly overlapped , on half of the dough circle . it 'll seem like a lot of eggplant in a small amount of real estate , but do n't worry ; it 'll settle as the calzone bake . drizzle the eggplant with additional sauce , if desired . top with 1 cup of the cheese . fold the uncovered half of dough over the eggplant and cheese , pressing the edges together to seal . repeat with the remaining piece of dough and filling ingredients . cut 3 or 4 slits in the top of each calzone , to allow steam to escape . brush with olive oil . let the calzones rest , uncovered , for 15 minutes , while you preheat your oven to 450°f . bake the calzones for 18 to 22 minutes , until they 're golden brown . remove the calzones from the oven , and slice into pieces to serve . yield : two 12 '' calzones , 4 o 6 servings total .

tips from our bakers

can you make this with whole wheat flour ? try substituting 1/2 cup of whole wheat for 1/2 cup of the all-purpose flour , to start ; if you like the result , increase the amount of whole wheat flour next time.many folks salt and drain their sliced eggplant before cooking , claiming it removes any potential bitterness , and helps prevent sogginess . we tried both salting/draining , and skipping this step , and thought the unsalted , undrained eggplant was nicely moist , compared to the salted . however , if salting/draining is something you 've always done , there 's no harm in continuing.here 's another way to approach eggplant parmesan calzone : simply use leftover eggplant parmesan as the filling . cut an appropriately-sized slice out of your casserole pan , lay it onto the dough , and go from there .

tips from our bakers

to mix and knead the dough in a bread machine : pour the wet ingredients into the bucket of your bread machine . add the flour and salt , then program the machine for dough or manual . you can let the dough rise in the bread machine ; just remember to check on it 45 minutes into its rest period . it will likely double before the full hour 's rest.because we 're partial to a lighter-textured bread , we chose to add a second rest after we 'd shaped the loaf . joy 's original recipe , without the second rest , makes an equally tasty loaf with a bit heartier texture , as well as the added benefit of being ready to serve in a shorter amount of time . for this version , shape your bread , and put it straight into a preheated 375°f oven .

sourdough sandwich bread

when you think of sourdough bread , you probably envision a crusty , chewy , artisan-style loaf . but this bread , made with levain ( an overnight starter based on sourdough starter ) is a richly flavored , soft-textured sandwich loaf , perfect for all of your favorite sandwich fillings and for breakfast toast as well .

levain

128 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
128 g cool water ( 60° to 70°f )
44 g ripe ( fed ) sourdough starter

dough

631 g king arthur unbleached bread flour or king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour*
50 g baker 's special dry milk or nonfat dry milk
50 g sugar
2 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 teaspoons instant yeast
57 g unsalted butter , room temperature
340 g water ( 70° to 80°f )
298 g ripe levain
*all-purpose flour will produce a somewhat stickier dough .

to make the levain : mix all of the levain ingredients together and place in a covered container with room for the levain to grow . it will almost double in size , and will take about 12 hours to ripen ( ferment ) at room temperature ( 70°f ) . when perfectly ripened , there 'll be large bubbles ( mostly below the surface ) creating a somewhat rippled effect . it 'll appear almost fluffy . if the levain is covered with a froth of tiny bubbles , it 's a bit over-ripened ; but do n't worry , you can still use it . to make the dough : mix and then knead together all of the dough ingredients , including the levain , to make a smooth , supple , and not overly sticky dough . place the kneaded dough in a lightly greased bowl , cover the bowl , and let the dough rise for 1 to 2 hours , until doubled in size . divide the dough in half , and shape each half into 8 '' logs . place the logs in two lightly greased 8 1/2 '' x 4 1/2 '' bread pans . cover the pans with lightly greased plastic wrap ( or a couple of plastic shower caps ) , and let the loaves rise until they 've crowned about 1 '' over the rim of the pan , about 1 to 2 hours . towards the end of the rising time , preheat the oven to 375°f . bake the bread for 30 to 35 minutes , until the crust is golden brown and the sides of the loaf feel firm . remove the loaves from the oven , and turn them out of the pans onto a rack to cool . let them cool completely before slicing .

tips from our bakers

does your baked yeast bread ever develop a wrinkled top surface ? here 's a tip to help prevent that . slash the top of the loaf several times before baking , much as you would a baguette . this helps release the steam that gathers under the crust , which can produce wrinkles as the baked loaf cools .


daily bread

this simple bread can be made every day . the dough can easily be turned into rolls or bread sticks , as well . you can make this bread dough in a number of different ways . the simplest is in a food processor using the plastic dough blade . you can also use a mixer or bread machine , or mix the dough by hand . however you do it , your goal is a smooth dough that 's quite soft ; please see `` tips , '' below , for guidance on how much flour to use depending on what season of the year it is .

227 g warm water
1 teaspoon active dry yeast or instant yeast
1 teaspoon granulated sugar
269 g to 326 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt

to make the dough with a food processor : pour the warm water into the processor and sprinkle the yeast and sugar on top . put the lid on the processor and pulse for a split second , just to wet the yeast . add 1 cup of the flour , process for 10 seconds , and let rest for 10 minutes . this gets the yeast going , and lets the flour start to absorb the liquid . add the salt and the remaining flour , and process ; you want a very slack dough , one that barely forms a rough ball . remove the dough from the food processor bowl , place it in a large , lightly greased bowl , and cover with lightly greased plastic wrap . set it aside for 8 to 10 hours . to make the dough using an electric mixer : combine all of the ingredients , and mix and knead to make a smooth , soft dough . place the dough in a large , lightly greased bowl , and cover with lightly greased plastic wrap . set it aside for 8 to 10 hours . to make the dough using a bread machine : put all the ingredients into the machine , program it for basic white bread , and let the machine go through its first knead ( 25 minutes or so ) . cancel the cycle , and turn off the machine . let the dough rest for 8 to 10 hours , right in the machine . to make the dough by hand : stir the ingredients together with a spoon to make a rough mass . knead the dough , right in the bowl , for 8 to 10 minutes , until it 's smooth ( though still very soft ) . a bowl scraper helps the process along . grease the bowl , cover it with lightly greased plastic wrap , and set it aside for 8 to 10 hours . once the dough has risen , take it out of the bowl and make it into whatever you want . you 'll have enough dough to make 8 rolls ; 8 chewy , substantial bread sticks ; 1 italian-style loaf or baguette ; 1 round loaf , or a 12 '' focaccia . let the dough rise again , for an hour or so , until whatever you 've shaped is good and puffy . preheat the oven to 450°f about half an hour before you want to bake the bread . bake the bread for 15 to 20 minutes . remove it from the oven when it 's golden brown , and cool it on a rack . or bring it to the table and enjoy it immediately !

tips from our bakers

because flour absorbs moisture from the air , and the air is moister in summer than winter , the amount of flour you 'll need in your bread recipes will be less in winter , more in summer . in this recipe , you 'll need about 2 1/4 cups flour in the winter , 2 3/4 cups in the summer , and 2 1/2 cups in the spring or fall . if you want a very crisp crust , mist the inside of the oven with cold water from a clean plant mister three or four times during the first 5 to 8 minutes of baking .

cheese-and-herb stuffed focaccia

so , what is the difference between pizza and focaccia ? both are yeasted italian flatbreads , generally cooked on the floor of a stone oven , and always adorned with toppings and/or fillings ranging from the simple ( herbs , olive oil and sea salt ) to the sublime ( fresh garlic , sun-dried tomatoes , olives , provolone , etc . ) .there 's actually a main difference , and a lesser one . these flatbreads are called focaccia in the north of italy , and pizza in the south . in addition , focaccia is generally a bit thicker than pizza , usually carries its enhancements in the dough rather than atop it , and tends to be adorned more simply ( though you could n't prove it by the following recipe ) . the focaccia below is an instant sandwich — it has its fillings baked right inside .

dough

425 g king arthur unbleached all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons instant yeast
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
7 g pizza dough flavor
25 g olive oil

113 g shredded mozzarella or provolone
21 g fresh basil leaves
1/4 teaspoon maldon sea salt , fleur de sel or other large-flake salt

11 g olive oil

combine all of the dough ingredients , then knead — using your hands , a mixer , a food processor or a bread machine — to form a smooth dough . place the dough in a greased bowl , cover , and allow it to rise for 1 1/2 hours , or until it 's puffy . transfer the dough to a lightly floured or lightly greased work surface , knead it gently , then divide it in half . round each half into a loose ball , and allow the balls to rest , covered , for 10 to 15 minutes . roll one ball into a 10 '' to 12 '' circle . place it on a lightly oiled baking sheet or deep-dish pizza pan ( or onto a peel dusted with semolina if you 'll be baking the focaccia on an oven stone ) . top the shaped round with the filling ingredients , spreading them evenly over the surface , and leaving about 1 '' crust bare around the edges . roll the second half of dough into an equal-sized circle , then place it atop the filling . press the edges of the dough together firmly to seal the two circles . cover the focaccia with a damp cloth , lightly greased plastic wrap or a proof cover . preheat your oven to 425°f . allow the focaccia to rise for 45 minutes , or until it 's noticeably puffy . just before placing it in the oven , dimple it ( poke gentle indentations into it ) with your fingers , brush it with 1 tablespoon olive oil , and sprinkle it with large-flake salt and rosemary . bake the focaccia for 30 to 35 minutes , until it 's golden brown . remove it from the oven , and serve it warm , or at room temperature . store , well-wrapped , for 3 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to a month .

tips from our bakers

want to increase the loaf 's tenderness , plus keep it fresh longer ? try the tangzhong technique , an asian method for increasing the softness and shelf life of yeast bread and rolls . begin by measuring out the flour and milk you ’ ll be using in the recipe , going with the greater amount of flour ( 4 1/4 cups ; 18 ounces ) . now take 3 tablespoons ( 3/4 ounce ) of the measured flour and 1/2 cup ( 4 ounces ) of the milk , and put them in a saucepan set over medium-high heat . cook the mixture , whisking constantly , until it thickens and forms a thick slurry ; this will take about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 minutes . transfer the cooked mixture to a bowl , let it cool to lukewarm , then combine it with the remaining flour , milk , and other dough ingredients . proceed with the recipe as directed . both the dough and the shaped loaves can be slow risers , especially in the winter . let the dough rise in the bowl until it 's noticeably puffy , albeit not necessarily doubled in size . once the loaves are in the pans , let them rise until they reach about 3/4 of the way up the pan . this could take as long as 2 hours or so if your house is on the cool side.alter the filling to taste by substituting your favorite dried or fresh herbs for the chives , garlic , seeds , and herbs in the recipe . or use olive oil instead of butter in the dough , and pesto instead of butter as the filling . or mix grated cheese into the butter mixture and sprinkle more cheese on top before baking .
for a sweet version of this bread , use 1/2 cup baker 's cinnamon filling or a mixture of butter and maple sugar instead of the herb filling . drizzle the top of the baked loaf with confectioners ' sugar glaze if you like .

if you 're using active dry yeast , proof the yeast with a pinch of sugar in 2 tablespoons of the lukewarm water . if you 're using instant yeast , you can skip this step . combine the dissolved yeast ( or instant yeast ) with the remainder of the ingredients . mix and knead everything together — by hand , mixer or bread machine set on the dough cycle — until you 've made a smooth dough . *see `` tips , '' below . place the dough in a lightly greased bowl . cover the bowl , and allow the dough to rise , at room temperature , for 1 to 2 hours , or until it 's quite puffy but not doubled in bulk . while the dough is rising , make the filling by whisking together the sugar , cinnamon , and flour . gently deflate the dough , and transfer it to a lightly greased work surface . gently stretch and pat it into a 6 '' x 20 '' rectangle . brush the dough with the egg/water mixture ; you wo n't use all of it , but save what 's left . sprinkle the dough evenly with the filling , leaving one short end bare . starting with the short ( 6 '' ) end covered with filling , roll the dough into a log . pinch the ends to seal , and pinch the long seam closed . transfer the log , seam-side down , to a lightly greased 8 ½ '' x 4 ½ '' loaf pan . tent the pan loosely with lightly greased plastic wrap . allow the bread to rise until it 's crested about 1 '' over the rim of the pan , about 1 hour . while the dough is rising , preheat the oven to 350°f . brush the top of the bread very lightly with some of the reserved egg/water mixture , and sprinkle with additional cinnamon-sugar . bake the bread for about 40 minutes , tenting it lightly with aluminum foil after the first 20 minutes . the bread 's crust will be golden brown , and the interior of the finished loaf should measure 190°f on an instant-read thermometer . remove the bread from the oven , and gently loosen the edges with a heatproof spatula or table knife . turn it out of the pan onto a rack . allow the bread to cool completely before slicing . store , well-wrapped , for 5 days at room temperature , or freeze for up to 3 months .

tips from our bakers

adjust the dough 's consistency with additional flour or water as needed ; but remember , the more flour you add while you 're kneading , the heavier and drier your final loaf will be . if you 're kneading in a stand mixer , it should take about 5 minutes at second speed , and the dough should almost clean the sides of the bowl , perhaps sticking a bit at the bottom . in a bread machine ( or by hand ) , it should become soft , smooth , and elastic .

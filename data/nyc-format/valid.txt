detmold sourdough bread

breads , yeast , sour , yeastfree

1 x no ingredients

preparation of starter , first evening

it is best to make a new starter with every batch of bread . to 1/2 tsp
detmold powder , add 1 cup warm ( 85f ) water and approximately 1 cup of
flour , such that the mixture has the consistency of thick soup . cover
and keep in a warm place ( e.g . the oven with light on ) for 24 hours .
there should tehn be bubbles in the mixture and a dark coloured
liquid should have separated .


preparation of starter , second evening % % % % %


add the starter mixture to 8 cups of warm water and optionally cooked
sweet rice ( see below ) . add sufficient flour to give the consistency
of thick soup . cover and let sit overnight in a warm place . the
sponge can be made from water and flour only , but a much sweeter
bread results from using a significant amount of cooked sweet rice .
twoo cups of dry sweet rice can be cooked in 8 cups of water and
allowed to cool for the sweet rice ingredient mentioned above .

preparation of dough , next morning

the sponge has now risen , and 1 cup of this could be saved for
subsequent starter if kept refrigerated and used within a few days .
however , even in the refrigerator , the mixture will soon acquire wild
yeasts and no longer be completely yeast-free . add to the risen
starter more flour until it becomes a kneadable dough . this will
require 12-18 cups of whole wheat flour . knead the dough as little
as possible . form the dough into loaves ( about 5 ) and place into well
oiled pans . ordinary bread pans do work , but the bread tends to be
thick crusted and to dry quickly . round cans such as coffee cans , or
48 oz juice cans give a bread that rises better and dries less
quickly . cover the pans with aluminum foil and let them sit in a
warm place for at least 4 hours .

baking bread , afternoon

place the loaves in a cold oven and turn the oven to 350f . bake for
about 1-1/2 hours total oven time . freeze the bread if it is not
going to be used within the next few days . it is best to use freezer
bags with the air drawn out , and double sealed .

consistency of yogurt and a curd has formed . ( you can test the
mixture by tilting the container . if the mixture does n't flow freely
when the container is tilted , it 's ready . ) the curding process takes
about 18 to 24 hours . you 'll need to check it periodically . if some
clear liquid rises to the top of the milk , stir it back in . note : if
the liquid turns pink , discard the batch and start again . once the
curd has formed , add the flour and stir until smooth . cover again and
let stand in a warm place until the mixture is full of bubbles and
has a good sour smell . this should take about 2 to 5 days . again , if

cake doughnuts ( crocker )

breads , crockpot

1 vegetable oil
3 1/3 cup all-purpose flour*
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon shortening
3 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2 eggs

heat oil ( 2 to 3 inches ) in deep fryer or dutch oven to 375f beat 1.5
cups of the flour and the remaining ingredients in 1.5-quart bowl on
low speed , scraping bowl constantly , 30 seconds . beat on medium
speed , scraping bowl occasionally , 2 minutes . stir in remaining flour .

turn the dough onto generously floured cloth-covered board ; roll
around lightly to coat with flour . gently roll 3/8 inch thick cut
with floured doughnut cutter . slide doughnuts into hot oil with wide
spatula . turn doughnuts as they rise to surface . fry until golden
brown , 1 to 1.5 minutes on each side . remove carefully from oil ( do
not prick surfaces ) ; drain . serve plain or shake one at a time in a
bag with powdered sugar . 2 dozen doughnuts ; 150 calories per doughnut .

*if using self rising flour ; omit babng powder and salt .

buttermilk doughnuts : do not use self rising flour . substitute
buttermilk for the milk . decrease baking powder to 2 ts and beat in 1
ts baking soda .

note : hot fat cools somewhat when foods are dropped into it . while
foods are frying , temperature of fat should be 370f to 380f . if fat
is too hot , foods brown before they are cooked through ; if too cool ,
foods become grease-soaked . a deep-fat thermometer is a good
investment ; checking it helps maintain a constant temperature . do not
use a candy thermometer for deep-fat fiying as it does not register
high enough .

1 karen mintzias
1 pkg active dry yeast

4 1/2 cup plain flour
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground masticha
1/2 cup butter ; melted
1 egg ; for glazing
1 blanched split almonds

new year bread is traditionally cut at midnight on new year 's eve .
after baking , a coin is inserted through a slit in the base . the
person who finds the coin will have luck in the new year . long ago
the coin used to be a gold one , then later a silver coin was used .
these could be incorporated into the dough before baking . nowadays
because of the nickel content of coins it is undesirable to bake a
coin in the cake .

dissolve yeast in 1/4 cup of the milk . add remainder of milk , eggs ,
orange rind and sugar . sift 3 cups flour , salt and spice into a warm
bowl and make a well in the centre . pour in yeast mixture and stir to
blend in flour , gradually adding warm melted butter . mix dough with
hands until it comes away from sides . turn on to a floured surface
and knead until smooth and elastic , adding remaining flour as
required . knead for 10 minutes . place ball of dough in a clean bowl
brushed with melted butter . turn dough over to coat top with butter
and cover bowl with a cloth or plastic wrap . leav to prove ( rise ) in
a warm place until doubled in bulk . punch down and turn on to lightly
floured surface . knead lightly and shape into a round loaf . place on
a large greased baking sheet or in a greased 25 cm ( 10 inch ) deep
cake tin . cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled - about 1
1/2 to 2 hours .

glaze with well-beaten egg and arrange blanched almonds in numbers to
denote the new year , pressing in lightly . bake in a moderately hot
oven for 45 minutes until golden brown and cooked when tested . if
bread browns too quickly place a piece of greased brown paper on top .

here 's a bagel recipe # 2

breads

1 x no ingredients

once the dough has risen , turn it onto your work surface , punch it
down , and divide immediately into as many hunks as you want to make
bagels . for this recipe , you will probably end up with about 15
bagels , so you will divide the dough into 15 roughly even-sized
hunks . begin forming the bagels . there are two schools of thought on
this . one method of bagel formation involves shaping the dough into a
rough sphere , then poking a hole through the middle with a finger and
then pulling at the dough around the hole to make the bagel . this is
the hole-centric method . the dough-centric method involves making a
long cylindrical `` snake '' of dough and wrapping it around your hand
into a loop and mashing the ends together . whatever you like to do is
fine . do not , however , give in to the temptation of using a doughnut
or cookie cutter to shape your bagels . this will pusht them out of
the realm of jewish bagel authenticity and give them a distinctly
protestant air . the bagels will not be perfectly shaped . they will
not be symmetrical . this is normal . this is okay . enjoy the
diversity . just like snowflakes , no two genuine bagels are exactly
alike .

begin to preheat the oven to 400 degrees farenheit .

once the bagels are formed , let them sit for about 10 minutes . they
will begin to rise slightly . ideally , they will rise by about
one-fourth volume ... a technique called `` half-proofing '' the dough . at
the end of the half-proofing , drop the bagels into the simmering
water one by one . you do n't want to crowd them , and so there should
only be two or three bagels simmering at any given time . the bagels
should sink first , then gracefully float to the top of the simmering
water . if they float , it 's not a big deal , but it does mean that
you 'll have a somewhat more bready ( and less bagely ) texture . let
the bagel simmer for about three minutes , then turn them over with a
skimmer or a slotted spoon . simmer another three minutes , and then
lift the bagels out of the water and set them on a clean kitchen
towel that has been spread on the countertop for this purpose . the
bagels should be pretty and shiny , thanks to the malt syrup or sugar
in the boiling water .

once all the bagels have been boiled , prepare your baking sheets by
sprinkling them with cornmeal . then arrange the bagels on the
prepared baking sheets and put them in the oven . let them bake for
about 25 mintues , then remove from the oven , turn them over and put
them back in the oven to finish baking for about ten minutes more .
this will help to prevent flat-bottomed bagels .

remove from the oven and cool on wire racks , or on a dry clean towels
if you have no racks . do not attempt to cut them until they are
cool ... hot bagels slice abominably and you 'll end up with a wadded
mass of bagel pulp . do n't do it .

serve with good cream cheese .

to customize bagels : after boiling but before baking , brush the
bagels with a wash made of 1 egg white and 3 tablespoons ice water
beaten together . sprinkle with the topping of your choice : poppy ,
sesame , or caraway seeds , toasted onion or raw garlic bits , salt or
whatever you like . just remember that bagels are essentially a savory
baked good , not a sweet one , and so things like fruit and sweet
spices are really rather out of place . submitted by

sourdough french bread

breads , sourdough

1 cup sourdough starter
1/2 cup milk ( any type , but i prefer whole ; milk )
1 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon shortening
2 1/2 cup flour

combine milk , sugar , salt and shortening in a pan . heat until shortening
melts , then cool to lukewarm ( about 110 degrees f. ) .

stir milk into starter . add flour gradually , forming dough that pulls away
from sides of the bowl . knead until smooth ( about 15 minutes ) , adding
flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the board . when done ,
the dough will be fairly heavy , but smooth in texture .

place in a well-greased bowl and raise in a warm place until doubled . form
into a long loaf ( about 16 inches long ) . place on a greased baking sheet
and let rise again , until almost doubled .

cut diagonal slits in top of loaf with a sharp knife and bake in a 400
degree oven until done , about 30-35 min . remove from pan and let cool in a
draft-free location .

notes :

* an old-fashioned sourdough french bread -- this is a hearty bread ,
possibly heavier than many people are used to . the flavor is wonderfully
tangy and complements just about any meal . try it with garlic butter !

this bread is slow raising . i usually spend two days on it , start the
dough one day , let it rise overnight , then form the loaf and bake the next
day . this recipe is from `` the complete sourdough cookbook , '' by don and
myrtle holm .

* be careful that the milk mixture has cooled before adding it to the
starter . if it 's too hot , you 'll kill the starter and the bread wo n't
rise .

* since the dough rises for a long time , i usually cover it with a damp
towel to keep it from drying out .

* if you want a chewy crust , brush the top of the loaf with a mixture of
corn starch and water before baking . also , placing a pan of water in the
oven while baking will make the crust a little softer . i usually brush the
loaf with butter after baking .

: difficulty : moderate .
: time : 1 hour preparation , long rising time , 1/2 hour baking .

2 tablespoon butter
1 about 3 1/2 c unbleached flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon sugar
1 egg white , beaten to a loose froth
1 cup whole milk

makes about 11 dozen 2 '' saltines from `` make your own groceries '' by
daphne metaxas hartwig .

use this dough to make a whole range of crackers - saltines ; oyster
crackers ; and big , round sea toast crackers .

kosher , sea , or table salt

melt the shortening and butter together ; let cool . sift 1 3/4 c of the
flour into a lg mixing bowl along with the baking powder , salt , and
sugar ; make a well in the center and pour in the shortening and
butter ; stir to combine , then stir in the egg white . add the milk
and beat vigorously to smooth out some of the lumps , then gradually
sift in enough flour to make a dough that will be stiff enough to
roll out . form the dough into a ball ; knead it for 10 min on a
floured surface until it is smooth and satiny . divide the dough into
2 equal balls , wrap each in wax paper and let them rest at room
temperature for 20 - 30 min .

on a floured surface , roll the first dough ball out as thinly as you
possibly can . cut the dough into 2 '' squares using a pizza cutter , a
ravioli wheel , or a very sharp , greased knife ; save the scraps . place
the dough squares just slightly apart from each other on ungreased
cookie sheet . sprinkle the squares with salt to taste and pat them
to embed the salt . prick each square several times with a fork . bake
in a preheated 375 f oven for 15 to 20 min until just slightly
browned . repeat for remaining dough ball and scraps .

sea toast

after the dough has rested , pinch off pieces about 1 1/2 to 2 '' round .
on a floured surface , roll each piece into the thinnest free-form
circle possible . place the circles on an ungreased cookie sheet ;
prick with a fork and bake at 375 f for about 15 min . very crispy
and perfect for cheese or soups . makes about 2 dozen .

oyster crackers

one rested dough ball at a time , roll the dough out as thinly as
possible ; transfer to a cookie sheet . cut the dough into diamond
shaped , 1 '' crackers with a ravioli wheel or a pizza cutter ; there is
no need to separate the crackers as the dough 's elasticity will do
the job . salt , embedded and gently prick the diamonds as previously
described . bake as directed for about 10 min .

nancy silverton 's grape starter

breads

2 cup bread flour
2 1/2 cup water
1/2 lb red grapes , stemmed

the grape starter is from julia child 's new master chef book ( $ 17.95
retail ) . it is a recipe given by nancy silverton . it takes 10 days to
complete but is then yours for life .

wrap the grapes in well washed cheesecloth , tieing the corners to
form a bag ; lightly crush them with a rolling pin ( to release the
sugar to mix with the natural yeast on the skins ; just like making
wine ! ) and immerse them in the flour water mix . cover tightly with a
lid or plastic wrap secured with a rubber band . leave at room
temperature for 6 days , stirring once or twice a day for the six days .

the bag of grapes will eventually appear inflated , and liquid will
begin to separate from the flour base . the mixture will begin to
taste and smell slightly fruity , and the color will be strange . that
is as it should be . by the sixth day the bag of grapes will have
deflated , the color will be yellow , and the taste pleasantly sour ;
the fermentation is complete . the starter is living but weak , and it
needs to be fed .

remove the grapes and squeeze their juices back into the starter .
stir it up thouroughly and transfer it to a clean container .
( although you can use it after just one feeding , the starter will be
stronger and healthier with the full treatment ) you can refrigerate
it until you 're ready to proceed .

three days before you plan to use it , stir 1 cup flour and 1 cup
water into the container , blending well . let stand uncovered at room
temperature until it bubbles up - 3 to 4 hours - then cover and
refrigerate . repeat this for the second and third day .

store the starter tightly covered in the refrigerator where it will
keep perfectly for 4 to 6 months.- after which it 's a good idea to
pour off all but 2 cups and give it another feeding . before using the
stored starter for bread , however , give it the full 3-day feeding
schedule once again to restore it and to tone down excess sourness .

this is the starter for the olive bread recipe which follows . from :

1/2 pint water
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 quart milk
1 teaspoon salt
8 cup flour ( variable )

`` salt rising bread is leavened by the fermentation of flour and milk .
bacteria are most important actors in this play . the yeast plants of
the air find the batter a good stage for development . salt rising
bread needs more heat while fermenting and a much longer time to
bake . here is a good example : ''

stir 2 tbsp . of corn meal into 1/2 pint of water heated to 130 f. add
1/2 tsp . of salt and mix very well . put this in a jar or crock , cover
and place it in a pan of water at 160 f. keep overnight in a warm
place .

in the morning , warm 1 quart of milk ; add 1 tsp . salt and enough warm
flour to make a heavy batter . gradually add the overnight corn meal
and beat well for a few moments . cover and keep in a warm place
about 2 hours .

gradually add flour and beat mix until it becomes a very soft dough .
turn out on a floured board and knead until it is elastically smooth .
divide equally into four portions , mold into loaves , and place each
in a greased bread pan . cover with a clean cloth and keep in a warm
place for 1/2 hour . bake in a 350 f. oven for 1 hour .

sourdough starter

breads , sourdough

2 cup water , warm ( about 110 degrees f . )
2 1/2 cup flour
1 pkg yeast ( dry ) , active ( optional )

get a container for the starter . crockery is best , but just about anything
can be used , except metal . try to get something with a lid . i use a vinyl
plastic food-storage container .

mix flour and water ( and optionally yeast ) . let the starter sit ( uncovered
or loosely covered ) in a warm place until bubbly and sour , about 3-5 days .

if you do a lot of bread baking , there will probably be enough yeast spores
floating around your kitchen so that the added yeast is n't needed . the less
yeast you add to the starter , the more `` authentic '' the flavor .

if the starter starts turning orange or green , throw it away . other nasty
things have started growing in it !

after the starter is ready , it can be used immediately . try to use some of
the starter once every few days , or it will start to die . the starter can
be refrigerated to last longer ( use at least every other week ) . make sure
the starter is at room temperature before using .

after using some of the starter , replenish what you take with equal amounts
of warm water and flour . let the starter sit until nice and bubbly before
using again .

notes :

* starter culture for making sourdough bread -- many people think of
sourdough as something from the gold rush days . not so ! sourdough was the
first way raised breads were made . `` way back then , '' there was no such
thing as yeast ( dry ) , active , and all breads ( along with a number of other
goodies ) needed sourdough starter to rise .

there are a number of recipes for sourdough starter , but this is one i 've
used , and it works fairly well . it came originally from the cookbook `` the
complete sourdough cookbook '' by don holm .

* usually , the first starter made will need a while to `` come up to
strength . '' best bets for first recipes are ones that do n't require much
raising , such as pancakes , or ones that have additional yeast .

: difficulty : easy .
: time : 5 minutes preparation , 5 days waiting .
: precision : no need to measure .

another recipe from james beard 's book , `` beard on bread '' . about this
bread james beard says , `` i learned to make this bread in norway , at
mrs ovenstad 's farm near oslo . she bakes it twice a week , and though
she resorts to heating the dough over steam for the second rising , it
comes out beautifully . she is also a deft pastry cook and gardner ,
and loves to eat . ( 2 large loaves ) ''

about 1/2 cup at a time . you may need to add 3 more cups , give or
take a bit .

form into a ball , place into a greased bowl , turn and cover . allow to
rise until doubled in bulk , probably about 1 hour .

punch down and knead 10 minutes , then cut into two equal pieces , form
loaves , and allow to rise again .

you may elect to allow the bread to rise a second time in the bowl .
if so , james beard feels that the bread may need some help in the
second rising , in the form of a bit of heat . i am not so sure , as
this was a very willing bread dough . then again , i almost always
rise my bread in a microwave oven anyway .

as to baking , this bread requires about 1 hour in a 400 f. oven .

this bread should have a good crunchy crust .

i have made this loaf without the wheat berries , as the crust and
bread is delightful without the berries , and some members of the
family refer to soft berries as `` erasers '' and hard berries as `` rocks ''
~ refusing to eat bread with either . however , with a bit of
practice , you will be able to use the wheat berries at the right
point so they will be neither `` rocks '' or `` erasers '' .

masa sovada ( portuguese sweetbread )

breads

1/4 cup water ( warm for dry ; lukewarm for compressed )
1 cup scalded milk
1 cup sugar
2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/2 cup butter or margarine
1/2 teaspoon of salt
5 1/2 to 6 cups all-purpose flour
4 eggs
1 2 packages yeast ( active dry or com ; pressed )

preheat oven to 350 degrees .

dissolve yeast in warm water . scald milk and add to sugar , butter and
salt ; stir until butter is melted . mix cinnamon and flour . add 1/2 the
flour to the milk/sugar/butter/salt , and mix until smooth . beat 3
eggs and add them and the yeast to the mixture .

continue to add remaining flour to make soft dough . remove it from
the bowl and place on floured board . knead until smooth and satiny
( about 15 mins. ) . shape into a ball and place in buttered bowl . cover
and let rise until double in size ( 2-1/2 to 3 hours ) .

punch risen dough down and divide it in half . place in two greased
pans ( 8 inches round ) . let rise in warm place until double in size
( 1-1/2 to 2 hours ) . brush tops of dough with remaining egg ( beaten ) .

bake in 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes or until golden brown . cool
on wire racks .

notes : i have found that if i initially heat up the oven and then
turn it off , i put the dough in there to rise and it rises twice as
fast .

also , i do n't know if this violates any rules , but i 've found that i
prefer this bread with raisins added .

finally , as i mentioned to those who have gotten this recipe already ,
this bread makes the best toast in the world ! ( personal opinion , of
course.. )

welsh cakes

breads , ethnic

1 lb self-raising flour
2 oz butter
4 oz sugar
4 oz sultanas and raisins
2 eggs
1/3 pint water

on sale in every welsh bakery , these are one of the great delights of
teatime . the are easy to make . the welsh use a flat iron `` planc '' ( a
griddle ) to bake the cakes , which are cooked on top heat like scotch
pancakes . a heavy frying pan will do fine if you do n't have a
griddle . makes 15-18 cakes .

rub the fat into the flour and add the fruit and sugar . mix the water
with the eggs and use to make a soft dough just a little firmer than
that for the scones . tip on to a well-floured board and roll out to a
thickness of 1/2-inch . cut out circles with a 2-1/2-inch shell-edged
cutter .

heat a planc or heavy iron frying pan - get the heat up into it
gently and thoroughly , and do not let it overheat . if the pan is not
well-seasoned or non-stick , slick it with a little butter or
vegetable oil .

bake the cakes on the pan , turning them once , until well-risen and
lightly browned . they will take about 5 minutes each side . eat hot
or cold , with or without salty butter , but always with a cup of
piping-hot tea .

james beard 's cheese bread

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 3/4 cup warm ( 100-115 deg ) water
5 to 6 cups all purpose flour
1 tablespoon salt , or to taste
1/4 cup butter , softened
1 teaspoon tabasco
1/4 cup parmesan cheese , freshly grated
3/4 cup gruyere or emmenthaler cheese , shre ; dded

dissolve the yeast with the sugar in 1/4 cup of the warm water and
allow to proof . in a large bowl , mix 5 cups of flour and the salt .
make a well in the center and add the remaining 1 1/2 cups warm
water , the butter , the tabasco , and the yeast mixture . stir with a
wooden spoon or spatula or with your floured hands until the dough is
well amalgamated . turn out on a heavily floured board ( use 1/2 cup
flour ) and knead for 10 to 12 minutes or until the dough is smooth ,
elastic , and rather satiny in texture and all the flour on the board
is absorbed ; add flour if you need it . place the dough in a buttered
or oiled bowl and turn to coat on all sides . cover with a towel and
let rise in a warm , draft-free spot until doubled in bulk , 1-1/2 to 2
hours or slightly more .
punch down the dough , turn it out on a lightly floured board , and
knead in the cheeses . when thouroughly blended , cut the dough in half
and let rest for 10 minutes , then roll out each half into a rectangle
about 11 x 6 inches and let rest for 2 or 3 minutes more . roll each
triangle up , pinching the edges as you do so , and tucking in the ends
so that the loaf measures about 4-1/2 x 7-1/2 inches . place the dough
in two well buttered tins , cover , and let rise in a warm spot until
the bread has reached the top of the tin , or slightly higher , or has
more or less doubled in size .
bake on the center of the middle rack of a preheated 375f deg oven
for approximately 30 minutes , or until the loaves sound hollow when
removed from the tins and rapped with the knuckles on both top and
bottom . bake directly on the oven rack , without the tins , for a few
minutes to firm the crust . cool the bread on racks before slicing .
variations :
* instead of the butter , use 1/3 cup peanut oil or olive oil . also
use oil on the baking tins .
* use fresh parmesan orromano only - a little over a cup - or use a
mixture of the two .
* use sharp shredded chedder instead of the gruyere cheese .
* bake as one loaf in a 10 x 4-1/2 x 3-inch pan , which will make a
thicker , more concentrated loaf and will take slightly longer to
bake . source : beard on bread by james a . beard alfred a. knopf , inc .

leaves are not available . the sinhalese term for the plant is
'karapincha ' , and if you can find them fresh , they add great depth
and flavor to a dish . they are not removed before serving , and they
are edible . there is no substitute for curry leaves .

mix 2 cups of the flour , the yeast and salt . add the water and oil ,

after the rising time , roll out the dough to fit whatever pizza pan or
baking dish you prefer . top as desired , then bake completed pizza for
12 to 14 minutes at 475 b0 f , testing for doneness after 10 minutes .

additional note : since i originally found this recipe , i 've learned
that a pizza stone is by far the best way to bake a pizza at home .
follow the directions that accompany the stone , but typically you
need to preheat both the oven and the stone ( i.e. , put the stone in
the oven in its final position while preheating the oven ) for at
least 20 minutes before placing the pizza in the oven to bake . the
crust should come out just great !

potato cakes ( bakestone recipes )

breads , vegetables , breakfast

1 lb cooked floury potatoes
1 teaspoon salt
2 oz butter , softened
4 tablespoon self-raising flour
1 butter for filling

potato cakes are eaten with bacon and sausages . it 's easier to make
them with hot , freshly cooked potatoes . if using cold potatoes , melt
the butter before adding it . choose a floury type of potato , and boil
in well-salted water . -- drain the cooked potatoes well , then return
to low heat in the same pan : put a dishcloth over the pan and allow
the potatoes to dry for 5-10 minutes . ( this is called `` drying in
their steam '' in ireland . ) they should be dry and floury at the end of
the process . sieve or rice into a mixing bowl with the salt . beat in
the butter . work in sufficient flour to make a soft dough which is
easy to handle . turn onto a floured board and roll or pat out to 3/4
inch thick . cut into rounds with a 3-inch scone cutter . place on the
hot greased bakestone and cook over a moderate heat until golden
brown underneath . turn and cook the other side . remove from the
bakestone , split , butter generously , and close again . keep warm while
cooking the next batch . serve hot . ( re `` self-raising flour '' : in
ireland and the uk , this is flour which comes with baking
powder/baking soda already included . for this recipe , about 1/4-1/2
t of baking powder mixed with a plain all-purpose flour will
substitute nicely . )

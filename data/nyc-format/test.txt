into the flour mixture . stirring constantly , pour in the milk in a
slow , thin stream and continue to stir until all the ingredients are
well combined .

gather the dough into a ball and place it on a smooth , slick surface
such as a jelly roll pan or marble slab . knead the dough for about 10
minutes , until the dough is smooth and can be gathered into a soft ,
somewhat sticky ball . sprinkle a little flour over and under it from
time to time while kneading to cut down on sticking .

moisten the hands with a teaspoon of ghee , gather the dough into a
ball , and place it in a bowl , cover with a towel , and let the dough
rest in a warm draft-free place about three hours .

slide two large ungreased baking sheets into the oven and preheat the
oven and the pans to 450 . divide the dough into six equal portions .

moistening the hands with ghi occasionally , flatten and form each
portion into a teardrop-shaped leaf , wide at the base and tapered at
the top . each leaf should be about six inches long and 3-1/2 '' across
at its widest point , and about 3/8 '' thick . arrange the bread leaves
side by side on the preheated baking sheets and bake them in the
middle of the oven for six minutes , or until they are firm to the
touch . slide the leaves under the broiler for a minute or so to brown
the tops lightly . serve hot or at room temperature .

sourdough chocolate cake

breads , cakes , chocolate

1/2 cup sourdough starter
1 1/2 cup all purpose flour
2 cup sugar
3/4 cup powdered cocoa ( not instant )
2 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup milk
1/2 cup vegetable oil
3/4 cup cold coffee
1 teaspoon vanilla

few people bake cakes from scratch anymore unless they can produce
something that 's not possible with a mix . this sourdough chocolate
cake falls in that category . it 's got a fudge-like quality you ca n't
get any way except with sourdough and since it 's all mixed in one
bowl , it 's almost as easy as a boxed cake .

put the starter in a large bowl , cover loosely and allow to stand at
room temperature until active and bubbling -- at least one hour . then
add the rest of the ingredients , in the order given , beating well
after each addition . it is not necessary to sift or premix any of
the ingredients as long as you are careful to get the baking powder
and soda evenly mixed .

grease and flour two 9-inch round cake pans , pour in the batter ,
which will be thin , and bake in a preheated 350. oven for about 30
minutes , or until the layers test done when poked with a toothpick .
the cake will have pulled away from the sides of the pan .

allow to cool about 10 minutes before removing from pans , then finish
cooling the layers on wire racks . do not frost until the cake is
completely cold .

a mild chocolate butter cream frosting is nice with this cake .

italian easter bread

breads , italian

1/4 cup sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 pkg dry yeast
2 1/2 to 3-1/2 cups unbleached flour
2/3 cup milk
2 tablespoon butter
2 eggs , at room temperature
1/2 cup mixed candied fruit
1/3 cup chopped blanched almonds .
1/2 teaspoon anise seed
2 tablespoon melted shortening
5 uncooked eggs colored with easter e ; gg dye
1 icing :
1 cup confectioner 's sugar
1 tablespoon milk
1/8 teaspoon vanilla

colored sprinkles

in a large mixing bowl , blend the sugar , salt , and yeast well with 1
cup of the flour . in a saucepan , combine milk and butter , heating
slowly until liquid is warm and butter is melted . pour the milk into
the dry ingredients and beat 125 strokes with a wooden spoon . add
eggs and 1/2 cup flour or enough to make a thick batter . beat
vigorously for 2 minutes .

then stir in enough flour to make a ball of dough that draws away
from the sides of the bowl . turn out onto a floured board and knead
for about 10 minutes , working in additional flour to overcome
stickiness . place the dough in a greased bowl , turning to grease the
top . cover tightly with plastic wrap and put in a warm , draft-free
place until doubled in bulk about 1 hour . meanwhile , combine the
fruit , nuts , and anise seed . punch down the dough and return it to a
lightly floured board . knead in the fruit mixture , keeping the syrupy
pieces dusted with flour until they are worked into the dough .
divide the dough in half . carefully roll each piece into a 24 inch
rope - the fruit and nuts will make this slightly difficult . loosely
twist the two ropes together and form a ring on a greased baking
sheet . pinch the ends together well . brush the dough with melted
shortening . push aside the twist to make a place for each egg .

push eggs down carefully as far as possible . cover the bread with wax
paper and let rise in a warm , draft-free place until double in bulk ,

here 's a bagel recipe

breads

6 cup ( to 8c ) bread ( high-gluten ) flour
4 tablespoon dry baking yeast
6 tablespoon granulated white sugar or light hon ; ey ( clover honey is good )
2 teaspoon salt
3 cup hot water
1 a bit of vegetable oil
1 gallon water
5 tablespoon malt syrup or sugar
1 a few handfuls of cornmeal
1 large mixing bowl
1 wire whisk
1 measuring cups and spoons
1 wooden mixing spoon
1 butter knife or baker 's dough blade
1 clean , dry surface for kneading
1 3 clean , dry kitchen towels
1 warm , but not hot , place to set dou ; gh to rise
1 large stockpot
1 slotted spoon
1 2 baking sheets

first , pour three cups of hot water into the mixing bowl . the water
should be hot , but not so hot that you ca n't bear to put your fingers
in it for several seconds at a time . add the sugar or honey and stir
it with your fingers ( a good way to make sure the water is not too
hot ) or with a wire whisk to dissolve . sprinkle the yeast over the
surface of the water , and stir to dissolve .

wait about ten minutes for the yeast to begin to revive and grow .
this is known as `` proofing '' the yeast , which simply means that you 're
checking to make sure your yeast is viable . skipping this step could
result in your trying to make bagels with dead yeast , which results
in bagels so hard and potentially dangerous that they are banned
under the terms of the geneva convention . you will know that the
yeast is okay if it begins to foam and exude a sweetish , slightly
beery smell .

at this point , add about three cups of flour as well as the 2 tsp of
salt to the water and yeast and begin mixing it in . some people
subscribe to the theory that it is easier to tell what 's going on
with the dough if you use your hands rather than a spoon to mix
things into the dough , but others prefer the less physically direct
spoon . as an advocate of the bare-knuckles school of baking , i
proffer the following advice : clip your fingernails , take off your
rings and wristwatch , and wash your hands thoroughly to the elbows ,
like a surgeon . then you may dive into the dough with impunity . i
generally use my right hand to mix , so that my left is free to add
flour and other ingredients and to hold the bowl steady . left-handed
people might find that the reverse works better for them . having one
hand clean and free to perform various tasks works best .

when you have incorporated the first three cups of flour , the dough
should begin to become thick-ish . add more flour , a half-cup or so at
a time , and mix each addition thoroughly before adding more flour . as
the dough gets thicker , add less and less flour at a time . soon you
will begin to knead it by hand ( if you 're using your hands to mix the
dough in the first place , this segue is hardly noticeable ) . if you
have a big enough and shallow enough bowl , use it as the kneading
bowl , otherwise use that clean , dry , flat countertop or tabletop
mentioned in the `` equipment '' list above . sprinkle your work surface
or bowl with a handful of flour , put your dough on top , and start
kneading . add bits of flour if necessary to keep the dough from
sticking ( to your hands , to the bowl or countertop , etc ... . ) . soon
you should have a nice stiff dough . it will be quite elastic , but
heavy and stiffer than a normal bread dough . do not make it too dry ,
however ... it should still give easily and stretch easily without
tearing .

place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl , and cover with one of your
clean kitchen towels , dampened somewhat by getting it wet and then
wringing it out thoroughly . if you swish the dough around in the
bowl , you can get the whole ball of dough covered with a very thin
fil of oil , which will keep it from drying out .

place the bowl with the dough in it in a dry , warm ( but not hot ) pace ,
free from drafts . allow it to rise until doubled in volume . some
people try to accelerate rising by putting the dough in the oven ,
where the pilot lights keep the temperature slightly elevated . if
it 's cold in your kitchen , you can try this , but remember to leave
the oven door open or it may become too hot and begin to kill the
yeast and cook the dough . an ambient temperature of about 80 degrees
farenheit ( 25 centigrades ) is ideal for rising dough .

while the dough is rising , fill your stockpot with about a gallon of
water and set it on the fire to boil . when it reaches a boil , add the
malt syrup or sugar and reduce the heat so that the water just barely
simmers ; the surface of the water should hardly move . submitted by

jewish rye bread

breads

1 poolish :
3 cup spring water , 75 degrees
1 1/2 teaspoon dry yeast
2 tablespoon sugar , raw or granulated
3 cup flour , unbleached bread
1 final dough :
2 cup rye flour , medium ground
1/4 cup caraway seeds
1 tablespoon oil , vegetable
1 tablespoon salt , sea
1 tablespoon sugar , raw or granulated
3 cup flour , unbleached bread

make & ferment the poolish ( allow 5 hours ) :
: combine the water , yeast , and sugar in a 6-quart bowl . let
stand 1 minute , then stir with a wooden spoon until yeast and sugar
are dissolved . add the unbleached flour and stir until the
consistency of a thick batter . continue stirring for about 100
strokes or until the strands of gluten come off the spoon when you
press the back of the spoon against the bowl . scrape down the sides
of the bowl with a rubber spatula . cover with a clean damp kitchen
towel or plastic wrap , and put in a moderately warm ( 74-80 degree )
draft-free place until it is bubbly and increased in volume . ( the
poolish can be refrigerated overnight . allow to stand at room
temperature for 2 hours before proceeding . )

mix & knead the final dough ( 20 minutes ) :
: measure the ingredients and make sure all ingredients ,
including the poolish are at 74-80 degrees . transfer the poolish to
your mixing bowl . add the rye flour , caraway seeds , oil , salt , and
sugar . stir with a wooden spoon until well combined . add enough of
the unbleached flour to make a thick mass that is difficult to stir .
turn out onto a well-floured surface . knead , adding more of the
remaining flour when needed until dough is soft and smooth , 15-20
minutes . the dough is ready when a small amount pulled from the mass
springs back quickly .

ferment the dough ( 2 hours ) :
: shape the dough into a ball and let it rest on a lightly
floured surface while you lightly butter or grease a large bowl .
place the dough in the bowl and turn the dough to coat the top . take
the dough 's temperature ; the ideal is 78 degrees . cover with a clean
damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm
( 74-80 degrees ) draft-free place until doubled in volume .
: note : if the dough temperature is higher than 78 degrees , put
in a cooler than 78 degree place like the refrigerator , until the
dough cools to 78 degrees . if it is lower than 78 degrees , put it in
a warmer than 78 degree place until the dough warms up to 78 degrees .
the point is to try to keep the dough at 78 degrees during its
fermentation . if you do have to move the dough , be gentle and do n't
jostle it , or the dough may deflate .

ferment the dough a second time ( 45 minutes ) :
: deflate the dough by pulling up on the sides and pushing down
in the center . re-form into a ball , return to the ball , and cover
again with a damp towel or plastic wrap . put in a moderately warm
( 74-80 degree ) draft-free place until doubled in volume .

ferment the dough a third time ( 45 minutes ) :
: deflate again the same as before , shape into a ball , return to
bowl , and cover again . put in a moderately warm ( 74-80 degree ) place
until doubled again .

divide & shape the dough into loaves ( 10 minutes ) :
: deflate the dough by pushing down in the center and pulling
up on the sides . transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface
and knead briefly . cut the dough into 2 equal pieces . flatten each
with the heel of your hand using firm direct strokes . shape each
piece into a tight ball for round loaves .

proof the loaves ( 1 hour ) :
: place the loaves on a lightly floured board . cover with a damp
towel or plastic wrap and put in a moderately warm ( 74-80 degree )
place until doubled in volume .

bake the loaves ( 45 minutes ) :
: 45 minutes to 1 hour before baking , preheat the oven and
baking stone , if you have one , on the center rack of the oven to 450
degrees .
: the oven rack must be in the center of the oven . if it is in
the lower third of the oven , the bottoms of the breads may burn , and
if it is in the upper third , the top crusts may burn .
: using a very sharp , serrated knife or a single-edged razor
blade , score the loaves by making quick shallow cuts 1/4 to 1/2 inch
deep along the surface . slide the loaves one at a time onto the
baking stone , if you are using one , and quickly spray the inner walls
and floor of the oven with cold water from a spritzer bottle . if
there 's an electric light bulb in the oven , avoid spraying it
directly ... it may burst . spray for several seconds until steam has
filled the oven . quickly close the door to trap the steam and bake 3
minutes . spray again in the same way , closing the door immediately so
that steam does n't escape . bake 12 minutes . reduce heat to 400
degrees and bake until loaves are a rich caramel color and the crust
is firm , another 15-20 minutes .
: to test the loaves for doneness , remove and hold the loaves
upside down . strike the bottoms firmly with your finger . if the sound
is hollow , the breads are done . if it does n't sound hollow , bake 5
minutes longer .
: cool completely on wire racks .

2 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
2 cup sugar
3 large eggs
1 cup oil
2 cup zucchini , grated
1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/2 cup pecans , chopped

sterilize 8 ball quilted crystal ( # 14400-81400 ) jam/jelly canning
jars , lids and rings by boiling them for 15 minutes . remove the jars
from the water and allow them to air dry ; leave the lids and rings in
the hot water until you 're ready to use them -- the rings must be hot
when used . if you can find them , you can also use 4 ( 1-1/2 pint )
straight-sided jars . they must not have buldges in the sides of the
jars or you wo n't be able to get the cakes out without digging them
out . look for the number of the jar i 've given you -- once you see what
they look like , you 'll know what to look for . once the jars are cool
enough to handle , grease them with shortening ( do not use butter ,
margarine , pam or baker 's secret ) . fill jars 1/2 full ; place onto a
cookie sheet .

preheat oven to 325-degrees ( no higher ! )

sift together the flour , salt , baking powder baking soda , cinnamon and
cloves ; set aside .

beat eggs until foamy . add sugar , oil , zucchini and vanilla . mix
well with beater . add flour mixture to zucchini mixture . add nuts .

for the pint jars , bake for about 35 minutes , moving the jars around
in the oven so they 'll bake evenly . start checking the cakes at 25
minutes , and go from there . the bread needs to be done , but not
over-done . for the 1-1/2 pint jars , bake for about 1 hour and 15
minutes ; start checking them at 1 hour and go from there .

using heavy duty mitts ( the jars are hot ! ) , remove the jars from the
oven one-at-a-time . place a lid , then a ring on top and screw down
tightly . place jars onto your counter top to cool completely . you 'll
know when they 've sealed , you 'll hear a `` plinking '' sound . in case you
do n't hear it , double- check the jars by pushing down in the middle
of the lids once the jars have sealed -- they should n't move at all .

chive & dill batter bread

breads

1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon or packet active dry yeast
2 cup ( 1pint ) lowfat cottage cheese
1/2 cup chopped chives ( onions or scallions ; )
1 heaping tbsp dill weed , or seeds
2 eggs
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 cup stone ground whole wheat flour
3 cup unbleached all purpose flour

there are particular batter breads that have become very popular over
the years and this is one of them . its full of dill , chives , and
lowfat cottage cheese , and contains no other fat at all . but it 's so
moist and chewy , you 'd never think of eating it with butter .

pour the warm water into a large mixing bowl and dissolve in it the
sugar and the yeast . while they dissolve , heat the cottage cheese in
a large saucepan until the chill is off . when it has warmed slightly ,
add the chives , dill , eggs , salt , baking soda , and flour . mix this
all up and add it to the yeast mixture , making sure it is all well
blended . the next part , the rising or proofing , takes time , but it 's
the yeast that doing all the work . you can determine how long it
will take by where you put the dough . if you want the yeast to work
quickly , say in 1-1/2 hours , put your bowl somewhere warm and cozy
( 75f-85f ) if you want the yeast to work slowly , say all day while
you 're at work , put the dough somewhere cool ( 55f-65f ) or in the
refrigerator . make sure your dough is covered so it does n't dry out ,
and then go away and do whatever you have to do . about an hour before
you want to serve your bread , stir it down , and pour it into two
small , lightly greased casserole dishes or 4-1/2x8-1/2 bread pans .
cover and let them rise again , this time for 3/4 to 1 hour . ( if the
dough is cold , the loaves may take a bit more time to rise . ) about 15
minutes before you bake your bread , preheat your oven to 350f . bake
the loaves for 30-35 minutes or until they are brown and crusty .

sourdough starter # 8

breads , sourdough

3 cup unbleached all-purpose
1 flour , divided
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cup hot ( 120f to 130f ) water
1 cup lukewarm ( 100f ) water
1 sourdough starter

yield : approximately 4 cups difficulty : ( one chocolate kiss , or easy )
prepartion : 10 minutes allow at least 4 days for the starter to
ferment before using . `` day 1 : 1 . in a medium bowl , stir together 2
cups of the flour and yeast . make a well in the middle of the
flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water . continue stirring
until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth . it is not
necessary to smooth out all the lumps ; they will dissolve as the
mixture start to ferment . cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
the mixture sit at room temperature . over the next 24 hours the
mixture will rise , become very bubbly and then start to recede .

`` days 2 and 3 : 2 . stir the mixture twice , once in the morning and
once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol .
towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
bubbles . by the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
liquid may form on the surface of the starter . it is simply the
alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
carbohydrates in the flour and multiply . refresh the starter by
stirring in the cup of lukewarm water ( 100f ) and the remaining cup of
flour . stir until blended , but do not worry about any small lumps .

`` day 4 : 3 . the starter is now ready to use , or it may be poured into a
sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole , or a
flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated .

olive bread with mint & onions

breads

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 cup warm water
1/2 cup whole wheat flour , preferably coars ; ely ground
3 to 3 1/2 cups white flour , preferab ; ly unbleached
3 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 small onion , chopped
2 teaspoon dried mint
12 black greek olives , pitted and halv ; ed
1 corn meal

makes 1 large round loaf

make a sponge by dissolving the yeast and sugar in the warm water and
stirring in the whole wheat flour and 1 1/2 cups of the white flour .
beat at least 50 strokes , then cover with plastic wrap and let stand
anywhere from 1 to 6 hours .

stir all but a teaspoon of the olive oil into the dough , as well as
the salt , the chopped onion , dried mint , and olives . then work in
remaining white flour until it becomes hard to stir .

turn the dough out onto a floured working surface and let rest while
you clean out the bowl . knead dough for about 8 to 10 minutes ,
adding more flour as necessary , until the dough is resilient . lightly
oil the bowl , return the dough to it , turning to coat , and cover with
plastic wrap . let rise until double in volume - about 1 1/2 hours .

turn the dough out , punch it down , and form into a large round loaf .
place on a baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal . cover loosely with
a towel and let rise again until double - about 45 minutes . ( or let
raise and bake in la cloche . )

if you have baking tiles in your oven , be sure they are good and hot
by preheating the oven to 425 f during the last 30 minutes of the
final rising . slip the loaf onto the tiles ( if you 're not using
them , simply put the baking sheet in the preheated oven ) and bake for
15 minutes , then lower the heat to 350 f and bake another 35 minutes .
brush with the remaining olive oil and let cool on rack .

damper

breads , australian

2 1/2 cup flour , self-raising
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon butter
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup milk
-- -- -or -- -- -
1/2 can powdered milk
1 can water

preheat oven to 350 degrees f. mix together the dry ingredients and the
butter . add the liquid and mix well . knead for about 5 minutes ( if you
do n't know about kneading , look in a good cookery book with plenty of
pictures , it 's difficult to describe in words ) .

shape into a flattened ball and place on a greased and floured baking sheet
or in a greased and floured round cake tin ( i recommend the latter , about 7
or 8 inch diameter , as it gives a better shape ) . bake for 30 minutes . use a
dutch oven if you are cooking in an open fire , and use your experience as
to cooking time .

serve in moderately thick slices while still fairly hot . i 'm told that
golden syrup ( a treacle-like substance made as a by-product of cane sugar
refining ) is the traditional thing to spread on it , and that goes well .
jam is good , too .

notes :

* bread as made by drovers in the outback -- i do n't know how many of you
realize it , but there is a wealth of tv programmes about cooking from
around the world . we are lucky in that australia 's sbs network ( special
broadcasting service `` multi-cultural television '' ) has a regular slot for
food and wine at a convenient time on saturday evenings . over the last
couple of years we have seen series on french , indian , chinese , english ,
vegetarian , australian and sri lankan cookery , among others . if you 're
missing out , why not call your local station ?

this recipe comes from a series called `` australian tableland '' .
traditionally , damper should be cooked in the coals of a camp fire , but the
temperature in an oven is much more consistent ! this recipe has the
advantages of being simple and , with ordinary care , reliable .

: difficulty : easy .
: time : 10 minutes preparation , 30 minutes cooking .
: precision : measure carefully .

notes : there was something odd about the taste of this one . perhaps
the ginger was a bad choice .

completely cooled . to defrost , set out at room temperature , loosely
wrapped , for about an hour .

these breads are great for making the house smell autumnal ! they

wild yeast sourdough

the chef or starter ( based by thorne on the method of lionel poilane )

1 . pour one-half cup of ( unchlorinated ) water into a bowl . work in
enough flour to make a `` moist but cohering dough . '' prac- tice will
make this stage obvious : when the soupy slurry turns to a solid ,
puttylike mass that can be massaged ( kneaded ) into a small , elastic
ball . please note that no commercial yeast has been added . this
starter will ferment , if it does ferment , be- cause of the presence ,
either in the ambient air or in the flour , of naturally occurring
yeasts and symbiotic bacteria .

2 . put the starter in a small bowl . cover with a damp dish towel
secured by a rubber band . leave on a shelf in a draft-free kitchen
for three days , re-moistening the towel as needed ( and when possible :
clearly , the atmosphere in your kitchen may dry out the towel so
rapidly that only round-the clock surveillance will really keep the
towel continually moist . eternal vigilance is impossible , but do your
best . also please note that no kitchen temperature is specified ,
since you will probably have to work with what you 've got . unheated
kitchens in severe winter weather are obviously not the ideal , but
the normal range of temperature in a modern home should work in
something like the times speci- fied here and below ) .

3 . the starter is activated when it looks and smells active .
fermentation produces a noticeable expansion in its size and a
slightly `` tangy '' odor . it can then be used or refrigerated for
several days .

the levain , or sponge : 8-ounce starter , 2 1/2 cups flour ,

put the starter in a bowl with 1 1/4 cups cold water ( cold to slow the
fermentation , on the theory that a long rising at this point improves
flavor and . be cause it relaxes the gluten , makes the job of working
in the water easier ) . work until the starter has completely
dissolved . ( thorne uses his hands : an electric hand beater is it much
more efficient . just add a little water at a time . ) stir in the flour
and the salt to make a loose mass . with floured hands move it to a
clean bowl . cover with a damp towel and a piece of plastic wrap .
secure with a rubber band and leave to ripen overnight in a cool
place ( thorne specifies 60 degrees ) .

the loaf : 1 sponge , flour , cornmeal

1 . put the sponge on a well-floured surface . begin to work in the new
flour . the idea is to knead in as much flour as the sponge will `` take ''
until it turns into silken , nonsticky dough that is a pleasure to
work . no amount of flour is specified . the limiting factor is the 1
1/4 cups of water added at the sponge stage . this kneading stage
takes 12 to 15 minutes , during which the movement activates the
elasticity of the gluten and traps air in the dough so that the yeast
can do its work .

2 . dust the dough with flour , put it in a large , lightly oiled bowl ,
cover with a damp towel and let rise to double in bulk . this is a
fairly fast rise and needs a warm environment , around 80 degrees , for
one to three hours , usually about two .

3 . flour your hands and gently rework the dough to break up air
bubbles . pinch off an egg-shaped piece of the dough and reserve as
the starter for subsequent adventures . line a colander with a
generously floured towel , and secure it around the colan- der 's
perimeter with a rubber band . set the dough on the towel and let rise
almost as far as it did on the first rise .

4 . preheat the oven to 450 degrees . heat the base of the bread cloche .

5 . when the dough is ready , sprinkle the cloche base liber- ally with
corn meal . then , grasping the towel , pick up the loaf , and roll it
gently onto the cloche base so that the round part faces up . slash
the surface in three places with a sharp knife or single edged razor
blade . place in oven , cover with cloche top , and bake for 15 minutes .

6 . reduce heat to 400 degrees and bake another 20 minutes . then
remove the cloche top to brown the crust for about 10 minutes . the
loaf is done if it sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom . after it
cools , store in a closed paper bag .

kona inn banana bread

breads , fruits

1 cup butter
2 cup granulated sugar
4 eggs ; beaten
6 ripe bananas ; mashed
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup macadamia nuts chopped

in a bowl cream the sugar and the butter well until a
light lemon color . then add the squashed bananas and
the beaten eggs . stir well until all ingredients are
completely mixed . sift the flour , the salt and the
baking soda into the creamed mixture then add the
chopped nuts . again mix until blended but make sure
you do not mix the batter too much . pre heat the oven
to 350 degrees and when the oven is up to temperature
pour the batter into two prepared loaf pans and bake
for 45 minutes . before my wife died she often watched
while i was making a mess in her kitchen doing my
imitation of a bakery chef . she said that the kona inn
banana bread should be renamed garbage bread because i
never stuck to the recipe and added all sorts of thing
that i found such as any kind of chopped nuts , lemon
and orange zest , chopped apricots , chopped mango ,
coconut flakes and one time i even added some
mincemeat that was left over after baking some mince
pies . perhaps the kona inn should have taken me to
court and forced me to stop making changes to their
banana bread . perhaps my use of their name for the
resulting strange flavored versions of their banana
bread had something to do with their going out of
business some years ago .

pizza dough

breads

5 cup flour
2 pkg yeast ( dry ) , active
2 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt
2 cup water

mix all of the dry ingredients first , then add the water . it will appear
to be too dry . do not add water . keep working the dough until it is smooth .
( this requires a little faith but it really works ) . let the dough rise once
( approx 1 hour ) . punch it down and knead again .

at this point you may choose to freeze some of the dough . if you do freeze
it , be sure to wrap it well and freeze it quickly . with either fresh or
thawed dough , let the dough rise a second time .

after it has risen , punch it down and use it for your pizza . the dough
will rise a little while you put the rest of your pizza toppings on it .
then bake as appropriate for pizza thickness and toppings .

notes :

* simple pizza dough -- i do n't remember where i learned this simple
recipe for pizza dough . it makes enough dough for two 12 x 18 pan pizzas . i
like it because it is so easy to memorize and it makes good pizzas . of
course , it is not quite as easy to memorize in its metric rendering . yield :
2 pizza crusts .

* i have tried variations like whole wheat , and just about any flour
combination that works for bread works for pizza dough .

: difficulty : easy .
: time : 20 minutes preparation , 2 hours rising .
: precision : measure the ingredients .

1 vegetable oil
-- -- cornmeal -- --
1 tablespoon sugar
1 cup warm water as above
1 envelope yeast
2 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose or
1 semolina flour
1 cup yellow cornmeal or polenta
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil or vegetable oil
-- -- new york -- --
1 cup warm water as above
1 envelope yeast
3 1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1/2 teaspoon salt

in a small bowl , dissolve the sugar or honey in warm tap water that is
110-115 deg f. ( when making the new york variation , omit the sugar and
proceed as follows ) . sprinkle the yeast over the water and stir gently
until it dissolves , about 1 minute . let stand in a warm spot until a
thin layer of foam covers the surface , about 5 minutes . discard
mixture and start over if bubbles have not formed within 5 minutes .

if making whole-wheat dough , combine the 2 flours in a bowl and use
as the flour in the directions that follow .

if making the cornmeal dough , combine the flour and cornmeal in a
bowl and use the mixture as the flour in the directions that follow .

to mix and knead the dough by hand : combine 3 cups of the flour with
the salt in a large mixing bowl . make a well in the center of the
flour and pour in the yeast mixture and the oil , if using . using a
wooden spoon , vigorously stir the flour into the well , beginning in
the center , and working toward the sides of the bowl , until the flour
is incorporated and the soft dough just begins to hold together .

turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface . dust your hands
with flour and knead the dough gently in the following manner : press
down on the dough with the heels of your hands and push it away from
you , then partially fold it back over itself . shift it a quarter turn
and repeat the procedure . while kneading , very gradually add just
enough of the remaining 1/4 c flour until the dough is no longer
sticky or tacky . this should take about 5 minutes . as you work , use a
metal dough scraper to pry up any bits of dough that stick to the
work surface . continue kneading until the dough is smooth , elastic ,
and springy . too much kneading overdevelops the gluten in the flour
and results in a tough crust .

after mixing and kneading the dough , shape the dough into a ball and
place it in a well-oiled bowl , turning to coat completely on all
sides with oil . cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap to prevent
moisture loss and set to rise in a draft-free warm place ( 75-85 deg
f ) until doubled in bulk , about 45 minutes for quick rising yeast to
1 - 1.5 hours for regular yeast .

with your fist , punch down the dough as soon as it has doubled in
bulk to prevent overrising . shape it into a ball , pressing out all
the air bubbles . if you are using bread flour or semolina flour , turn
the dough in an oiled bowl to coat once more , cover again with
plastic wrap and refrigerate it until puffy , from 35 minutes to 1
hour . omit this step if using all-purpose flour .

if you can not bake pizza withing 2 hours after rising , punch the
dough down again , turn it in an oiled bowl to coat once more , cover
the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate . the dough can be
punched down a total of 4 times and kept refrigerated up to 36 hours
before the yeast is exhausted and the dough unusable . let chilled
dough come to room temperature before proceeding .

yogurt pancakes

breads

5 large eggs
1 1/4 cup milk
8 oz yogurt , plain
4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup vegetable oil ( or less for dieters ; but use at least 2 t )
2 1/3 cup flour , white ( measure carefully aft ; er sifting )
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt

preheat griddle and oil very very lightly . separate the eggs ; beat the
yolks in a bowl big enough to hold the whole recipe . add the yogurt and
beat again ; add the milk and oil and beat again . rinse the eggbeater .

in a separate bowl , mix all the dry ingredients ( flour , baking powder ,
sugar and salt ) . sift together . i use a flour sifter for this , but if you
insist on measuring your flour without sifting it , then you can try using a
wire whip to blend the dry ingredients . using a clean eggbeater , beat the
egg whites until they are fluffy .

dump the dry ingredient mixture into the big bowl containing the milk
mixture , stir for about 2 seconds just to get the dry ingredients under the
surface of the liquid , and then dump the beaten egg whites into the big
bowl .

now beat this mixture lightly and slowly with a fork until it is more or
less uniform . if you beat too much , or too fast , then it will get gummy .
do n't try to get rid of lumps . cook on the hot griddle .

notes :

* i use dannon and knudsen yogart , other brands might require different
amounts

* amazingly good baking-powder and yogurt pancakes -- cooks like to show
off by making fancy glamorous recipes to serve to their friends by candle
light . here is a simple ordinary recipe to serve to your family for
breakfast in the morning .

i love pancakes and i make many varieties and i am an inveterate
experimenter . this recipe is the one i have developed over the years to
replace buttermilk pancakes because i never have buttermilk on hand in the
refrigerator like my grandmother did . i made this recipe this very morning
with blueberries in it . i do have yogurt in my fridge , though , and the
yogurt can substitute for the buttermilk . yield : serves 4-6 .

* i like to put fresh blueberries in these pancakes after i pour them on
the griddle . make sure that your maple syrup is hot and that your butter is
soft . you can heat syrup in the microwave or you can heat it by sticking
the syrup jar in a pan of boiling water .

* this same recipe also makes really good waffles if you reduce the milk
to about 1 cup , but if you are going to make waffles , you should n't cut
back on the oil . if you are dieting , stick to pancakes .

: difficulty : easy to moderate .
: time : 10 minutes plus cooking time .
: precision : measure carefully .

strucle z makiem

breads , holiday , polish

1/2 oz yeast ( dry ) , active ( two standard e ; nvelopes )
1/2 cup water , warm
4 1/2 cup flour , all-purpose
3/4 cup sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup butter
2 eggs
2 egg yolks ( save whites for the fill ; ing )
1/2 cup sour cream
vanilla -- -- poppy seed filling -- -- -
2 tablespoon butter
10 oz poppy seeds , coarsely ground
2 tablespoon honey
2 teaspoon lemon juice
2 egg whites
1/2 cup sugar
1/4 can candied orange peel , chopped fine
2 tablespoon lemon peel ; grated

make the dough : soften the yeast in warm water in a bowl . mix flour with
sugar and salt . cut in the butter until mixture has a fine , even crumb .

beat eggs and extra yolks ; mix with yeast , then stir into the flour
mixture . add the sour cream and the vanilla and mix well .

knead dough on floured surface for 5 minutes . divide in half and roll
each
half into a 12 inch square . cover .

make the filling : melt butter in a large pan . add poppy seed and
stir-fry
for 3 minutes . add honey , lemon juice and raisins to poppy seeds . cover
and remove from heat . let stand for 10 minutes .

beat egg whites with sugar until stiff moist peaks form . fold in orange
and lemon peels and then gently fold in poppy seed mixture .

spread half of the filling on each dough square ( after you uncover them ) .
roll up as you would for a jelly-roll and seal the edges . place on
greased
baking sheets and cover . let rise until doubled in bulk ( approx . 1 1/2
hours ) .

preheat oven to 350 degrees f. bake about 45 minutes , then remove from
oven and cool .

make the icing : mix powdered sugar and lemon juice until smooth . spread

notes :

* poppy seed rolls -- this recipe could be used as part of a 12-course
meal known in polish as wigilia , or on its own . wigilia is eaten after
sundown on christmas eve . yield : makes 2 rolls .

* you can grind poppy seeds in a mortar and pestle . specialty food
stores
sell grinders specifically designed for poppy seeds . some spice shops
sell
poppy seeds already ground , but like all spices they lose their freshness
much more rapidly after they are ground . this year ( 1987 ) in poland , the
people are having a very hard time finding enough poppy seeds for their
strucle z makiem because there is a government crackdown on the growing
of
all poppies in an attempt to control opium production .

1 pkg active dry yeast
2 cup warm water
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon sugar
2 tablespoon oil

makes 8 loaves oven temperature : 260 c ( 500 f ) cooking
time : 4-5 minutes

sift flour into a large mixing bowl and warm in a low

to make a thick liquid . cover with cloth and leave in
a warm place until frothy .

until smooth , either by hand for 10 minutes , or on
electric mixer using dough hook for 5 minutes .

sprinkle some of the reserved flour onto a board , turn
out dough and knead for 10 minutes , using more flour
as required . dough is ready when it is smooth and
satiny with a slightly wrinkled texture . shape dough
into a ball .

oil bowl , put in dough smooth side down then turn over
so that top is coated with oil . stretch plastic wrap
over bowl and leave in a warm place to rise until
almost doubled in bulk -- about 1 to 1-1/2 hours .

board . knead for a minute or so , then divide into 8
equal pieces , rolling each into a ball .

roll each piece into a 25 cm ( 10 inch ) round and place
on a lightly floured cloth . cover with another cloth

on highest setting with metal lid on , vent closed .
when heated , oil base quickly and slide dough onto
base . cover and cook for 3 minutes , remove lid , turn
bread over , re-cover and cook further 2 minutes .

james beard 's persimmon bread

breads , fruits , liquor

3 1/2 cup sifted all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon ground mace
2 cup to 2 1/2 cups granulated sugar
1 cup butter , melted
4 large eggs , lightly beaten
2/3 cup cognac or bourbon
1 *remy martin suzy 's choice
2 cup persimmon puree ( the pulp
1 of about 4md . persimmons - not nec ; essary to peel
2 cup coarsely chopped walnuts optional
2 cup raisins -optional

source : beard on bread 1973

sift all five dry ingredients into a mixing bowl . then make a well in
the center and add the melted butter , egg , cognac , persimmon puree ,
and if you like , the nuts and raisins . mix the dough until it is
quite smooth . smooth . butter and flour four molds* , fill them about
three-fourths full , , and bake for 1 hr . at 350 f. cool the loaves in
the molds and turn out on a rack .

note : wrap in foil after cooling if you wish to keep them . they will
keep nicely from 1 to 2 weeks .

persimmons grow in many countries of the world , but often , as in
france , they are left hanging on the trees . in this country ( usa ) we
have learned to appreciate their superb deep-orange color , their
shape , and their delicate flavor , and they are becoming increasingly
popular . in earlier times they were allowed to ripen on the trees
until dead ripe before being eaten raw or used for puddings , cookies ,
and breads . nowadays they show up in our markets in a firm state and
must be left at room temperature for several days or a week to ripen
until they are almost mushy .

this old recipe , sent to me by a dear friend from the middle west ,
makes a bread that is almost cakelike in texture . spread with good
fresh butter , it is very pleasant to eat along with a cup of tea or
to use for a cream-cheese sandwich . it is unusual , rich , and
thoroughly delicious .

*traditionally this bread is baked in four 1-pound buttered and
floured coffee cans , but you can use 3- to 4-cup charlotte molds ( my
preference , ( jb ) round pyrex dishes , or round stainless steel bowls .

1/4 cup water , lukewarm
7 tablespoon milk , dry
2 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup water
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
6 cup flour , all-purpose

in a small bowl , dissolve the yeast in about 1/4 cup lukewarm water .

in a large mixing bowl , mix the powdered milk , sugar , salt and about 1 3/4
cups water together . stir with a whisk until smooth , then add yeast
mixture .

sift in about 3 cups of flour and mix until smooth . add the oil ; mix .

gradually sift in the remaining flour . when it becomes stiff enough to
handle remove from the bowl and knead it as you add the flour . knead it for
5-7 minutes after the last flour is added .

place the dough in a oiled bowl and turn it over to coat uniformly . then
place it in a warm place to rise until it has doubled in size ( about 45
minutes ) .

remove from bowl and knead a little . divide into two equal parts , shape
into loaves , and place in loaf pans . let rise again until doubled in size .

preheat oven to 375 degrees f. bake 45 minutes . remove loaves from pans
and cool on a wire rack .

notes :

* ordinary white bread -- this recipe is derived from the basic bread in
the american heart association cookbook .

* this is good everyday bread . be careful : it 's easy to eat too much and
get fat . you may want to have someone who has made bread before help the
first time as the amount of flour may have to be adjusted depending on the
slight differences in your measurement of the liquids and the humidity of
the day . once you have done it it is easy to do by the feel of the dough .

: difficulty : moderate .
: time : 20 minutes preparation , 2 hours rising , 1 hour cooking and
cooling .
: precision : measure carefully .

lavosh

breads

1 pkg yeast , active , dry 1/4 oz
1 1/2 teaspoon sugar
1 cup water , warm 115 f
2 tablespoon water , warm 115 f
3 cup flour , all-purpose
2 oz butter , melted ( 1/2 stick )
1 tablespoon seeds , sesame , white , or
1 onions , chopped
1 seeds , poppy

pour the yeast into a clean , small , shallow bowl . add 1 teaspoon
of the sugar and 1/4 cup of the warm water . let the mixture stand for
2 to 3 minutes , then stir to dissolve the yeast completely . place the
bowl in a warm , draft-free place for 5 to 10 minutes or until the
mixture looks foamy and has almost doubled in volume .

measure your flour into a mixing bowl , and make a well in the
center of the flour . pour the yeast mixture into this center
depression , and then add the remaining water , sugar , and melted
butter to the yeast .

mix the ingredients well with a spoon until a soft , spongy dough
is formed . cover the bowl loosely with a warm , damp cloth , and
return it to the warm , draft-free spot until the dough again doubles
in volume , about 45 minutes .

preheat your oven to 350 f .

when the dough has risen , place it on a lightly floured surface
and divide it into six equal parts . with a lightly floured rolling
pin , roll each part into a flat round about 1/4 inch thick .

place 2 or 3 rounds on each of two or three cookie sheets . rub
the surface of the rounds lightly with cool water , and sprinkle each
with 1/2 teaspoon sesame seeds , or other topping . the water will
basically help the toppings to adhere to the rounds when baked .

bake the rounds in the oven on the bottom rack for about 20
minutes or until the breads are a pale golden brown . ( bake breads in
`` shifts '' if oven size does not allow entire recipe to be baked at
once . )

with a spatula , transfer the breads to a wire rack to cool .
breads will keep several days if stored in a dry , air-tight place .

swedish rye bread

breads , swedish

2 cup milk
1 cup water
1/2 cup brown sugar
1/2 oz dry yeast ( two packages )
6 cup rye flour ( approx )
3 cup flour , white ( approx )
1/2 cup sugar , granulated
1/2 cup vegetable oil
1/4 cup dark molasses
2 teaspoon anise seeds , crushed
1 teaspoon salt

scald the milk and combine it with the water and brown sugar in a very
large bowl . ( you need something that holds at least 4 or 5 quarts . ) when
the mixture is lukewarm , dissolve the yeast in it , then stir in about 2
cups rye flour and about 1 cup white flour to make a paste .

let the mixture rise in a warm place until it is light and foamy . this
usually takes about 30 minutes to an hour . check it frequently , it can
really make a mess if it rises enough to overflow the bowl . ( i 'm sure they
could make a great horror movie about a gigantic blob of bread dough that
keeps getting bigger and bigger as it consumes everything in its path ... . )

stir in the granulated sugar , oil , molasses , anise seed and salt , and
enough flour to make a stiff dough , using 2 parts rye to 1 part white .
knead the dough for about 5 minutes , or until it is smooth and elastic ,
adding more flour to keep it from sticking to your hands .

clean and grease the bowl . put the dough in the bowl , turning it to grease
all sides . cover the bowl loosely with a clean towel and let the dough
rise until it 's doubled in bulk . punch it down and let rise until double
again .

divide the dough into three loaves and put in greased pans . ( i usually
make round loaves and bake them on cookie sheets . ) cover with the towel and
let rise until double again .

bake for about 45 minutes at 350 degrees f. because of the high sugar
content , this bread can burn rather easily ; watch it closely so it does n't
get too dark .

notes :

* a sweet , dark whole-grain rye bread -- this recipe comes from my
great-grandmother , who emigrated from sweden and brought this recipe with
her . it makes a sweet , dark bread , and ( like most whole-grain breads ) it
tends to be a bit heavy . yield : makes 3 loaves .

* rye flour can be a little hard to find these days . you may have to
visit a store that specializes in natural foods . avoid the kind that is
very coarsely ground with big chunks of bran in it , though ; this does n't
seem to have any gluten at all in it , and since the proportion of rye flour
is so high in this recipe , the texture of the bread will come out all
wrong . you need something that looks more like ordinary flour .

herman starter *

breads

-- -- i.e.s.jjgf65a -- --
-- -- philly.inquirer -- --
2 tablespoon or 2 envelopes active dry
1 yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 cup sugar
2 cup all purpose white flour
2 cup milk ( see note )

day,1 : sprinkle yeast over warm water.add 1 tablespoon of the sugar
and let stand a few minutes until yeast is active and swelling.combine
remaining sugar , flour and milk in a 4 t0 6 quart glass , plastic or
pottery bowl or container . ( do not use metal bowls or utensils as
these may retard starter growth . ) with a wooden spoon , stir in active
yeast mixture.cover loosely with a towel so herman can breathe.let
stand in a warm draft free place overnight .
days,2,3 , and 4 : stir daily with a wooden spoon.keep covered.keep
cool .
day,5 : stir in 1/2 cup sugar,1 cup milk and 1 cup flour.let stand 24
hours .
days,6,7,8 , and 9 : stir daily with a wooden spoon .
day,10 : repeat day 5 , stirring in 1/2 cup sugar,1 cup milk and 1 cup
flour .
this gives you enough starter to use freely in recipes and/or give
away . herman may be replenished as needed but can go no more than 5
days at room temperature between feedings.after feeding , wait 24 hours
before using the renewed starter .
daily stirring helps keep yeast mold from forming .
most directions specify that herman not be refrigerated since cooler
temperatures slow the growth and `` souring '' of the starter.it
is , however , a safer course for busy cooks with fast growing
startersherman also is freezer-friendly and may be kept on ice
between baking impulses if you get board .
note : if desired , substitute butter-milk for milk in starter for more
flavor and less fat.if more starter is needed , additions may be
doubled when 2 or more cups of starter are used ... ..

jim 's yorkshire pudding

breads , beef , puddings , english

1 3/4 cup flour
1 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk ; at room temp .
4 eggs ; at room temp .
1 cup water ; at room temp .
1 beef drippings or melted suet for t ; he pan .

many yorkshire pudding recipes in american cook books call for butter
and all milk/no water ; that 's a pop-over or something not a real
yorkshire pud . this pudding needs no butter or fat in the batter as
there is plenty of beef fat in the pan for flavor . the ingredients
are so simple that the final product is a real surprise to first time
cooks 'cause it 's so good ! it used to be the custom in england to
cook the pudding in a tray under the roast and catch all the
drippings . you get a tastier result from making small puddings in
muffin trays in a hot oven after the roast is out as they puff up
more and brown nicely .

in olden days it was served before the roast which would be served
with gravy covered potatoes and bread to stretch out the meat .
today 's diet conscious hosts would usually serve the puddings with
the roast instead of potatoes and bread .

n.b . the ingredients must be at room temp when mixed to maximize the
puffing effect .

preheat the oven to 400 f

in a bowl , stir together the flour and salt . make a well in the
centre and pour in the milk . stir . in another bowl beat the eggs
until fluffy and then add the water . beat this mixture into the
batter until large bubbles form . [ let stand up to an hour if you need
to finish the roast . ]

heat the muffin tins in the oven . pour beef drippings or melted suet
into each muffin hole to a depth of 1/4 '' . it should be hot enough to
sizzle but not smoke . pour in the batter about 5/8 '' to 3/4 '' deep .
bake at 400 f for about 20 minutes ; reduce heat to 350 f and bake
another 10 to 15 minutes . serve at once with the roast , gravy , and
hot mustard or horseradish .

crumpets & muffins ( english )

breads

1 quart water
2 oz yeast
1/2 lb potatoes
1/2 oz salt
1 flour

muffins : wash , peel & boil the potatoes , rub through a colander , add
the water ( just warm enough to bear the hand in it without
discomfort ) ; then dissolve the yeast & salt in it , & stir in
sufficient flour to make a moist paste . beat it well in a deep bowl &
then clear off the paste from the hands ; cover over with a clean
cloth & leave it to rise in a warm place . when it has well risen , &
is light & spongy , turn it out on the table , dredge over with flour ,
& then divide it off into pieces about 3 oz in weight , roll them up
into round shapes , & set them on a wooden tray , well dusted with
flour to prove . when light enough , see that the hot plate is hot , &
then carefully transfer the muffins from the tray , one at a time ,
using a thin tin slice for the purpose , taking particular care not to
knock out the proof or the muffins will be spoilt . when they have
been properly cooked on one side , turn over with the slice & cook the
other side . when the muffins are done , brush off the flour , & lay
them on a clean clothe or sieve to cool . to toast them , divide the
edge of the muffin all round by pulling it open to the depth of about
1 inch with the fingers . put it on a toasting fork & hold it before a
clear fire till one side is nicely browned , but not burnt ; turn , &
toast it on the other . do not toast them too quickly , otherwise the
middle of the muffin will not be warmed through . when done , divide
them by pulling them open ; butter them slighlty on both sides , put
them together again , & cut them into halves . pile on a hot dish &
send quickly to table . time : 25 to 30 minutes to bake . sufficient for
about 2 dozen muffins . crumpets : proceed exactly the same as directed
for muffins ( above ) , but stir in only half the quantity of flour used
for them , so that the mixture is more of a batter than a sponge .
cover over , & leave for 1/2 an hour . at the end of that time take a
large wooden spoon & well beat up the batter , leave in the spoon ,
cover over , & leave for another 1/2 an hour . then give the batter
another good beat up . this process must be repeated 3 times with the
intervals . when completed , see that the hot plate is quite hot , lay
out some crumpet rings rubbed over inside with a little clean lard on
a baking tin , & pour in sufficient of the batter to make the
crumpets . when cooked on one side , turn over with a palette-knife , &
when done take off on to a clean cloth to cool . muffins & crumpets
should always be served on separate dishes , & both toasted & served
as quickly as possible . time : about 20 minutes to cook . sufficient
for about 2 dozen crumpets .

injera ( `` sour dough '' )

breads

1 3/4 cup unbleached white flour
1/2 cup self rising flour
1/4 cup whole wheat bread flour
1 pkg dry yeast , about 1 tablespoon
2 1/2 cup warm water
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

combine the flours and yeast in a ceramic or glass bowl . add the warm
water and mix into a fairly thin , smooth batter . let the mixture sit
for three full days at room temperature . stir the mixture once a day .
it will bubble and rise .

when you are ready to make the injera , add the baking soda and salt
and let the batter sit for 10 to 15 minutes .

heat a small , nonstick 9 inch skillet . when a drop of water bounces
on the pan 's surface , take about 1/3 cup of the batter and pour it in
the skillet quickly , all at once . swirl the pan so that the entire
bottom is evenly coated , then return to the heat .

the injera is cooked on only one side and the bottom should not
brown . when the moisture has evaporated and lots of `` eyes '' appear on
the surface , remove the injera . let each injera cool and then stack
them as you go along .

if the first injera is undercooked , try using less of the mixture ,
perhaps 1/4 cup , and maybe cook it just a bit longer . be sure not to
overcook it .
injera should be soft and pliable so that it can be rolled or folded
like a crepe .

perfect buttermilk biscuit

breads , breakfast

1/2 cup shortening
2 1/4 cup flour
2 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 cup buttermilk

place shortening in small plastic food bag . flatten shortening between
plastic sheets so it is thin and return to freezer . this allows
shortening to become hard enough to break , into tiny pieces when
added to dry ingredients . tear 2 pieces wax paper about 15 inches
long and place on counter , sift flour , baking powder , baking soda ,
sugar and salt onto wax paper . place empty sifter on top of bare
sheet of wax paper , lift sheet of wax paper holding sifted dry
ingredients by sides and pour through sifter , sifting onto bare wax
paper . sift back and forth 3 times , then sift once more into large
mixing bowl . remove shortening from freezer . cut into small bits ,
about 1/4-inch square . drop shortening bits into bowl of dry
ingredients and , using fingertips , lightly rub shortening and flour
together , occasionally tossing flour mixture so you touch all
particles of shortening with flour . when mixture has bits of
flour-covered shortening throughout , begin adding buttermilk . using
fork , add buttermilk , lightly stirring to mix with dry ingredients .
cover board or surface with dusting of flour . gather sticky mass of
dough and place on floured surface . dust hands with flour and gently
knead dough , adding enough flour only to make dough manageable . pat
dough with hands or roll with floured rolling pin into round 1/2-inch
thick . using 2-inch cutter , cut out biscuits and place touching each
other in 3 rows , in center of greased baking sheet . place on middle
rack of 425-degree oven and bake 12 minutes , or until lightly golden .
remove from oven and serve hot or warm . makes 19 ( 2-inch round )
biscuits . ***note : :by marion cunningham thanks to eula mae dore , a
great southern cook from avery plantation , la. , i 've learned to make
the best buttermilk biscuits i 've ever had . eula mae says a good
biscuit is one of the best things to have on hand for quick meals .
she uses them in emergencies to make simple sandwiches filled with
scraps of ham or cheese and serves them with pickles and a small
salad . for dessert , she warms a biscuit or two and makes a shortcake
with fresh fruits or berries . she has convinced me that you ca n't
have too many biscuits on hand . eula mae learned to cook and bake
from her grandmother , not from cookbooks , and the artfulness of her
preparation was a joy to watch . here are some of her biscuit-making
tips : + first go out and replace your baking powder , unless you
bought it within the last four months . more baking flops occur from
old , tired baking powder than from any other cause . and do n't rely on
the old test of checking the freshness of baking powder by putting a
spoonful in a glass of water to see if it fizzes . baking powder , like
a carbonated drink , can fizz a little and still be almost flat .
buying new baking powder costs very little when you consider the cost
of baking failures . + next , eula mae insists that sifting the dry
ingredients four times is the reason her biscuits are perfect . i
tested the recipe sifting and not sifting and , indeed , sifting does
make a slightly higher , more tender biscuit . + after you cut the
biscuit dough , put the pieces on a baking sheet upside down . this
ensures a taller , lighter biscuit by making sure any edges crimped by
the pressure of the cutting do n't interfere with the rise . ( the
french use the same trick when making puff pastry . ) + the tip that
helped me the most was using less flour than usual . eula mae 's dough
was soft and sticky . she handled it gently , dusting her hands and the
dough with only enough flour to make the dough manageable . the result
was a lighter biscuit .

fougasse aux grattons ( provencal flat bread w

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
1 lb flour*
250 ml tepid water
1 each egg yolk , beaten
1 lb belly of pork , diced
2 lb pork fat , diced
12 tablespoon dry white wine

*flour should be a mixture of unbleached white bread flour with 2
generous handfuls of buckwheat flour , sifted together . if you ca n't
find the buckwheat flour , do n't worry about it . for the dough : stir
together the yeast and a handful of flour in enough water to make a
runny batter . leave for 1 hour . warm the remaining flour in the oven ,
mix in salt and make a well in the middle . pour in the yeast mixture
and add enough tepid water to make a moist dough . knead for 10-12
minutes on a lightly floured surface . leave to rise in a large
floured bowl covered with a dampened cloth . when the dough has
doubled in size , turn out onto a floured work surface , punch down and
flatten the dough out . add the grattons ( see immediately below for
how to make them ) . preheat the oven to 450f/250c . for the grattons :
cook the meat , fat and wine over a *very* gentle heat in a heavy
covered saucepan . press down on the meat several times during cooking
to render up as much fat as possible . after 1 1/2 - 2 hours , pour the
liquid off through a strainer . ( it can be used instead of olive oil
for cooking , and often was , in provencal cooking . ) crisp the diced
meat over higher heat , straining off any liquid fat when necessary .
to make the fougasse , make the bread dough , and after the first
rising mixin the grattons . then , with a knife , cut through the dough
first one way , then another . reform into a ball and repeat . gather
the pieces together into a mass , divine in two and form into two flat
loaves , slashed straight through their thickness in numerous places .
spread the holes wider with your fingers . ( you are striving for an
effect like a flat sheet of bread with holes like those of a slice of
swiss cheese . ) brush the top with the egg yolk and bake on a hot
metal sheet fgor 30-35 minutes until crisp and golden . serve warm
with a bitter salad like endive or dandelion . nb : this is a very rich
bread ++ more like a salty shortbread than anything else . but *very*
good .

easy corn bread

breads

3/4 cup corn meal
1/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup milk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 each egg , beaten

heat oven to 400 degrees . grease 8 or 9 inch baking pan . combine dry
ingredients . stir in milk , oil and egg , mixing just until dry
ingredients are moistened . pour batter into prepared pan . bake 20 -
25 minutes or until lightly brown and wooden tooth pick inserted near
center comes out clean . serve warm . serves 9 . microwave directions :
mix ingredients same as above and pour batter into ungreased pan .
microwave on high 5 - 6 minutes , rotating 1/4 turn after 2 minutes .
let stand 5 minutes before serving .
hope this is simple enough ... .. as the recipe says ... only mix
ingredients until moistened . if you beat it too much it would come
out solid rather than light and airy . i cover the baking pan with
saran wrap leaving part of one corner pulled back for steam to get
out when i put it in the microwave ... seems to help it bake more
evenly . the center will seem a little soggy when you take it out but
remember it continues to cook during that 5 minutes before you serve
it . time also makes a difference depending on the wattage of your
micro . i think i leave mine in for about 7 minutes .

owendaw corn bread

breads

1 cup cooked hominy
2 tablespoon butter
2 eggs
1 cup milk
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/2 teaspoon salt

hominy gives this bread it 's distinctive flavor . like all spoon
breads , it should be eaten very hot with plenty of butter . do try
this one it will change your mind about grits .

this recipe orignally appeared in the carolina housewife . the last
line in the recipe is taken verbatim from the orignal by the authors .

while hominy is hot , stir in the butter . beat eggs until light and
add to hominy , then add milk . stir in cornmeal and salt . this makes a
very thin batter . pour into a deep , buttered pan and bake in a 375
degree f. oven for about 30 minutes ( about 1 hour in a glass baking
dish ) . this will serve 6 .

when baked , it has the appearance of a baked batter pudding , and when
rich and well mixed it has almost the delicacy of baked custard .

1 cup whole wheat flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup club soda

combine flours and baking powder in a bowl . add club soda plus
about 4 cups water . mix into a smooth , fairly thin batter . heat a
large , non-stick skillet . when a drop of water bounces on the pan 's
surface , dip enough batter from the bowl to cover the bottom of the
skillet , and pour it in quickly , all at once . swirl the pan so that
the entire bottom is evenly coated , then set it back on the heat .
when the moisture has evaporated and small holes appear on the
surface , remove the injera . it should be cooken only on one side , and
not too browned . if your first one is a little pasty and undercooked ,
you may need to cook a little longer or to make the next one
thinner . but , as with french crepes , be careful not to cook them too
long , or you 'll have a crisp bread that may be tasty but wo n't fold
around bits of stew . stack the injera one on top of the other as you
cook , covering with a clean cloth to prevent their drying out .

been thawed and warmed to glaze and decorate . )

2 cup self-rising flour*
1/4 cup kraft american cheese**
1/2 teaspoon garlic powder -- not salt

1 muffin paper liners

*you may use all-purpose ( regular ) flour , however biscuits will not
rise much and have a denser texture ; flavors should be about
identical . **can substitute 3 packets of sweet & low for the sugar .
use the cheese in the gold cardboard container . original recipe does
not say , but i would think you will want to shred it .

in a 1 1/2 qt mixing bowl combine the milk , mayo , sugar , and flour .
beat on high speed with electric mixer for almost a minute , until
smooth and completely combined . using a rubber bowl scraper , streak
the dough with the cheese . batter should not be thin enough to pour ;
if necessary , add only enough additional flour so batter will `` drop ''
from spoon . drop batter into 10 paper-lined muffin tins , or a greater
number of tiny muffin cups . ( muffins tend to triple in size when
baked ; fill lightly . ) melt butter ; mix in garlic , and brush tops of
dough . you may shake 1 tsp additional cheese on each muffin if you
wish . bake for 25-30 minutes , or until golden . cool in pan on rack
for 30 minutes .

these definitely should be served freshly baked and hot .

bowl and make a well in the centre . pour in yeast mixture and stir

cake tin . cover and let rise in a warm place until doubled - about 1
1/2 to 2 hours .

denote the new year , pressing in lightly . bake in a moderately hot
oven for 45 minutes until golden brown and cooked when tested . if

notes :

* traditional german christmas bread -- germans traditionally eat stollen
around christmas time . this recipe comes from someone i went to school
with . she , and her parents , who are from southern germany , recommended it
as quite an authentic recipe . it is indeed a very tasty and rich bread .
makes 1 large or 2 small loaves .

* my loaves of stollen come out somewhat wide and short . some
traditionalists make them long and narrow . you can also make them in
normal bread pans instead of on cookies sheets , in which case you should
increase the baking time somewhat .

: difficulty : moderate .
: time : hand-on time : 30 minutes ; rising times : 1 1/2 hours + overnight
+ 1 hour ; baking time : 30-35 minutes .
: precision : measure the ingredients , though you can experiment with the
fruits and nuts .

gobhi paratha

breads , indian

-- -- dough -- --
4 cup whole-wheat flour
1 to 3 cups cold water
3/4 cup ghee
-- -- cauliflower filling -- --
2 tablespoon ghee
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh ginger root
1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
1/2 cup finely chopped onions
1 teaspoon turmeric
1/8 teaspoon ground hot red pepper
1 medium cauliflower , trimmed , and coarsely ; chopped
1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh hot green chil ; i ( caution )
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon salt
6 to 8 tablespoons ghee

indian flat bread with spiced cauliflower filling

dough :

prepare the whole-wheat dough in the following fashion : in a small
bowl , combine the whole-wheat flour and 1/4 cup of the ghee . with
your fingertips rub the flour and fat together until they look like
flakes of coarse meal . pour 1 cup of water over the mixture all at
once , knead together vigorously , and gather the dough into a compact
ball . if the dough crumbles , add up to 2 cups more water , 1/4 cup at
a time , until the particles adhere .

on a lightly floured surface , knead the dough by folding it end to
end , then pressing it down and pushing it forward several times with
the heel of your hand . repeat for 7 or 8 minutes , until the dough is
smooth and elastic . again gather it into a ball . place the dough in
a bowl , drape a kitchen towel over the top , and let it rest at room
temperature for at least 30 minutes before rolling it .

cauliflower filling :

meanwhile , in a heavy 10 to 12-inch skillet , heat 2 tablespoons of
ghee over high heat until a drop of water flicked into it splutters
instantly . stir in the ginger and garlic , then the onions . lower the
heat to moderate and , stirring constantly , fry the mixture for 7 or 8
minutes , until the onions are soft and golden brown . watch carefully
for any sign of burning and regulate the heat accordingly .

stir in the turmeric , red pepper , cauliflower , chili , cumin and salt .
reduce the heat to low , cover tightly and cook for 10 minutes , or
until the cauliflower is tender but still slightly resistant to the
bite . to make the parathas , divide the cauliflower mixture into 9
equal portions . divide the dough also into 9 portions and drape a
dampened kitchen towel over them to keep the dough moist .

one at a time , on a lightly floured surface , roll a ball of dough
into a round about 5 inches in diameter . place a portion of the
filling mixture in the center of the round and fold the edges over
it , pressing them together to enclose the filling securely . pat the
filled paratha flat with your hands , then gently roll it again to
make a round about 5 inches in diameter . as you shape and fill the
parathas , set them aside , covered with a dampened kitchen towel to
keep them from drying out .

heat an ungreased 10 to 12-inch skillet with a non stick finish or a
well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or griddle until it is hot enough for
a drop of water flicked into it to splutter instantly . place one of
the parathas in the pan and , moving it about constantly with your
fingers or the edge of a metal spatula , cook for a minute or so . with
a wide spatula , turn the paratha over and brush about a teaspoon of
the ghee on the top . cook for 2 minutes , then turn it over , spread
with another teaspoon of ghee and cook for i minute . turning
frequently , continue to cook until the paratha is brown on both
sides . ( when you have mastered the technique , you will find you can
fry 2 or 3 parathas at a time , depending on the size of your skillet
or griddle . )

serve the parathas warm , as a mealtime bread . they are traditionally
accompanied by plain yoghurt or any rayta . parathas may be cooked
ahead and reheated in a hot ungreased skillet for a minute or so on
each side .

makes nine 5-inch breads .

1 ingredients
1 *-+*
2 cup flour
3 tablespoon sugar
1 envelope active dry yeast
1 teaspoon salt
2 cup warm water ( 105 to 115 degrees )

***** herman 's starter *****

directions *-+*

in large bowl mix flour , sugar , yeast and salt . gradually stir in the
water ; beat or whisk until smooth . cover with towel ; set in warm ( 80
to 85 degree ) draft-free place-the kitchen or other warm room in
summer , or in cold weather on top of insulated furnace or radiator ,
on a buffer such as a folded towel or pillow . stir 2 or 3 times a day
for about 3 days or until starter is bubbly and produces a yeast
aroma . transfer to a larger bowl , large jar or plastic container .
cover partially ( tilt lid or punch holes in plastic cover ) ;
refrigerate . makes about 1 1/2 to 2 cups starter , depending on
thickness . it can be creamy or as thick as dough because of room
conditions , the age of `` herman '' and other variables .

the flavor of this starter evolves as it ages-mildly sweet when
young , more like sourdough when older .

herman is replenished only after you use it . if that is going to be
longer than 14 days , then put it in the freezer until ready to use .

2 1/2 cup lukewarm water
1 teaspoon dry yeast
6 cup unbleached all purpose flour -- ( 6 ; to 7 )
2 tablespoon olive oil plus extra for oiling sur ; faces
2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup pitted and chopped black olives ( ny ; ons or
1 kalamata )
1/4 cup buckwheat flour

recipe by : baker 's dozen show # bd1a29 you will need a large bread
bowl , four 10- by 15- inch or larger baking sheets that will fit in
pairs side-by-side in your oven , a sharp knife or razor blade , and a
pastry brush . place water in a large bowl , sprinkle on yeast , then
stir in 2 1/2 cups of the all purpose flour . stir 100 times in the
same direction ( one minute ) to develop the gluten , then leave this
sponge covered with plastic wrap for 30 minutes or up to two hours .
stir in olive oil , salt , olives , and buckwheat flour . mix in
remaining flour , a cup at a time , stirring always in the same
direction , until dough becomes too stiff to stir . turn dough out onto
a well floured working surface . using floured hands , knead gently
until the dough has an even consistency ( apart from the olives ) , then
knead 5 minutes longer . clean bread bowl , oil it lightly , place dough
in the bowl , then cover with plastic wrap . let rise for 2 to 3 hours .
it will have almost doubled in volume . oil two 10 by 15 inch ( or
larger ) baking sheets . flatten dough down gently with your hands ,
then turn out onto floured working surface . cut dough in half , return
half to the bread bowl and cover . divide remaining half in two . knead
each half into a ball and then flatten gently with the palm of your
hand . let stand five minutes to rest . working with each piece in
turn , flatten out with your palms into a rectangle or oval about 10
inches long and 5 to 6 inches wide . it will be about 1/2 to 3/4 inch
thick . transfer each to a lightly oiled baking sheet at least 14
inches long . let loaves rise for 20 to 30 minutes , covered with a
damp towel or plastic wrap . preheat oven to 400 degrees and set rack
at the center of the oven or just above . ( if your baking sheets do
not fit side-by-side on one rack , place two racks in oven , one just
above the center and one just below . one bread can go on each rack ;
about halfway through baking ( after 10 to 12 minutes ) , switch the
two around . ) just before placing in the oven , use a sharp knife or
razor blade to make cuts through the breads : starting two inches from
the top and about an inch from the side , cut across the bread to
within an inch of the other side . make two more cuts , parallel to
the first , at about 2 inch intervals ( the cuts should go all the way
through the dough ) . the dough will separate at each cut , so that the
bread looks like a kind of fat-runged ladder ; you can pull dough
apart even more if you wish and if your baking sheets are long
enough , by pulling gently on each end of the breads to make the slits
gape more . brush each loaf lightly with olive oil all over , place in
the oven , and bake for 20 minutes . breads will be golden when done .
once first two loaves are in the oven , oil two more baking sheets ,
then flatten remaining dough , divide into two , and repeat steps
required to form loaves . breads should almost have finished rising by
the time the first batch comes out of the oven . yield : 4 loaves

king arthur - sourdough bread with yeast

breads

1 1/2 cup lukewarm water
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon ( or packet ) active dry yeast
1 cup sourdough starter
5 1/2 cup ( to 6 1/2 cups ) king arthur all-pur ; pose flour
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon vegetable oil

`` many recipes for sourdough breads include some active
dry yeast to spped up the process , the sourdough
starter included mainly for flavor . we recommend
beginning sourdough bakers start with this bread
before moving on to the classic sourdough bread which
follows . this version makes a quicker loaf with a
slightly different texture and taste , and is a good
introduction to the sourdough process . ''

cornmeal to sprinkle on baking pans

making the sponge : in a large mixing bowl , dissolve
the sugar and yeast in the warm water . let this sit
for 10 minutes or so until bubbly . add the starter and
stir . gradually add 3 cups of flour , stirring until
well mixed and smooth .

cover this sponge and set it aside in a warm ,
draft-free place for 4 to 5 hours .

making the dough : stir down the sponge . stir in 1
cup of flour , the salt and oil . gradually add flour
until the dough no longer sticks to the sides of the
bowl .

turn the dough out onto a lightly floured board and
knead for 3 to 4 minutes . let the dough rest while
you clean and grease your bowl . continue kneading
another 3 or 4 minutes or until the dough is smooth
and elastic . add only enough flour to the board to
keep the dough from sticking . place dough in the
greased bowl and let rise until doubled in bulk , 1 to
2 hours .

shaping & baking : knock down the dough and shape it
into two long french- or italian-style loaves . place
them on a cornmeal-sprinkled baking sheet and let them
rise for another 1 to 1 1/2 hours .

toward the end of the rising period , place a baking
pan on the oven bottom ( or on the lowest rack ) and
preheat your oven to 450 degrees .

just before baking , slash the tops diagonally every
couple of inches , about 1/4 '' deep , and brush with cold
water .

pour 2 or 3 cups of water into the pan , put the loaves
on the rack above the steaming water , and bake for
about 25 minutes .

the crust will be very hard when you remove the bread ,
but in 5 minutes it will be soft and chewy . to make
the crust crisp and chewy , turn the oven off and leave
the bread inside for an additional 5 minutes .

west coast french sourdough bread i

breads

1 cup starter
1 pkg dry yeast
3/4 cup flour
3 cup flour
3/4 cup water
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon soda
1 1/2 cup warm water
2 cup flour
2 teaspoon sugar

about 9:00 in the evening measure out 1 cup starter from the
refrigerator storage jar into mixing bowl ( do not use metal or
plastic ) . add 3/4 cup water and 3/4 cup flour and beat thoroughly .
cover bowl tightly with clinging transparent wrap and set in warm
place ( 80 to 85 ) overnight .

in the morning about 7:00 beat starter thoroughly . measure out 1 cup
and return remaining starter to storage jar . in another bowl pour
1-1/2 cups of just warm water , stir in 2 tsp . sugar and sprinkle 1
pkg . yeast on top . let stand until yeast is dissolved . add the 1 cup
of reserved starter and 3 cups flour . beat thoroughly , cover tightly
and let stand in warm place until very light and foamy . this will
take from 1 to
1-1/2 hours .

sift 2 tsp . salt and 1/2 tsp . soda with 1 cup flour and spread the
remaining 1 cup on the pastry board . stir the sifted flour mix into
the sponge . turn out on board and knead for several minutes using a
little more flour if necessary to make a very stiff dough . knead
until completely smooth and not sticky so that it can be worked on an
unfloured portion of the board without sticking . divide in halves and
shape into either round or long narrow loaves . place on flat baking
sheet , preferably non stick , or lightly grease it or sprinkle corn
meal over the surface . slip into large plastic bag , supported so that
it will not touch dough ( drinking glasses placed at each end of sheet
are fine ) . set in warm place for 1 to 1-1/2 hours to rise .

if the dough becomes too light the loaves will spread in baking but
this only makes a more delicious crust . when ready for the oven brush
top of loaves with cold water . make diagonal slashes across top of
long loaves and five or six radiating from center of round ones with
a sharp single-edge razor blade or scissors . bake in oven preheated
to 400 degrees with pan of hot water on the floor from 50 to 60
minutes and the crust is as dark as desired . about 10 minutes before
the end of the baking period , brush tops with water again . remove
from pans and stand on edge to cool , propping them against a heavy
glass jar or similar object .

for the most attractive slices , especially if the loaves have spread a
little to much in baking , cut with a very sharp knife diagonally
across the long loaf and at the same time have the blade slanted from
top to bottom away from the end . this makes the slices about twice as
wide as when cut straight up and down . cut slices from the round
loaves on the slant also . when ready to seve , to preserve the utterly
delicious taste and crisp , hard crust , re-heat quickly with wrapping
open at one end so that the bread will not become steamy , or spread
slices with butter and place under broiler at high heat for a very
short period until the edges are beginning to brown nicely . this
recipe makes 2 long or 2 large round loaves .

puff pastry

breads , misc

3 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup plain bleached cake flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 cup iced water ( approximately )
6 1/2 sticks chilled sweet butter

makes about 2 3/4 lbs dough , making a 36- by 12-inch rectangle 1/4 ''
thick . to measure flours , scoop dry measure cups into a container and
sweep off excess with the flat edge of a knife . rapidly cut the
butter into big dice ; toss butter and flour together on your work
surface . mixing it rapidly with the flour , flatten the chilled
butter into lima-bean size . do it by hand or in an electric mixer
with a flat beater . ( a food processor cuts butter too small . ) if
butter has softened , chill everything 20 minutes . blend in 3/4 cup
of iced water , lifting and turning , adding droplets more until
mixture holds together . a mess ! push , pat and roll dough into a
rough rectangle ; flour the top lightly as necessary . if it breaks
too much , sprinkle on drops of water . it will look quite awful . when
the rectangle is 18 '' long , flip one end over onto the middle , then
the other end , like folding a letter , making 3 layers . scrape and
flour work surface . turn dough so top flap opens on your right .
push , pat and roll it again into a rectangle . clean rolling pin and
flour it lightly ; if dough softens , refrigerate at once . again fold
the dough into 3 ; use a pastry sheet to help . again roll it out into
a rectangle . to prevent it from sticking , keep dough floured , work
surface clean . these rolls and folding into 3 layers are known as
`` turns '' -- you now have made 3 turns . make the fourth turn , shoring
up the edges with side of rolling pin . by this time , you have a real
dough . wrap and refrigerate for 45 minutes at least -- to relax it .
complete the fifth and sixth turns and it is ready to roll out and
form . see also `` julia child 's tips on puff pastry '' and `` additional

1/2 teaspoon salt
1 pkg yeast ( dry ) , active
2 2/3 cup flour , whole wheat ( unsifted )

it until the dough is covered with olive oil . leave the dough in the bowl ,
cover with a cloth , and let rise for 1 1/2 hours , or until doubled in size .

preheat oven to 350 degrees f. punch the dough down , knead again for a few
seconds . roll the dough out with a rolling pin , as if you were making a

slightly-oiled baking sheet . press a cross into the top surface of each , so
that it can be easily broken apart .

notes :

* an earthy , whole-wheat bread used for communion -- in pittsburgh and
other western pennsylvania parishes of the episcopal church , it is common
to use small , thin loaves of real , fresh , home-made bread at communion
instead of the pressed wafers popular in most other places . the bread has a
chewy texture to it , keeps tremendously well , and makes a great lunchbox
food ( each `` loaf '' is about the size a large cookie ) . this recipe comes from
father bill coats of the church of the redeemer in pittsburgh . yield : 8-10
single-serving loaves .

* you can freeze these loaves easily ; either put them in single-serving
ziploc bags and use them for school lunches , or freeze a bunch in a large
food-storage bag .

: difficulty : moderate .

top of melted butter , sprinkle with nutmeg . bake at 425 f. for 15 to

serve with preserves or marmalade . i find that splitting the batter
in two halves , and baking it in metal pie plates works well , that way
you do n't have to cut it in half . a squirt of fresh lemon juice , a
dusting of powdered sugar , and far too much apricot preserves on top
makes it a fantastic breakfast ...

pasta frittata

appetizers , breads , pasta , cheese , eggs

4 egg
2 cup cooked spaghetti -- cut 1 in
1 lengths
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1/4 cup parmesan cheese -- grated
2 tablespoon olive oil
1/2 cup mozzarella cheese -- diced
2 large roma tomatoes -- diced
2 green onions -- chopped
2 oz prosciutto -- sliced
2 tablespoon italian parsley -- chopped

1 . in a large mixing bowl , beat the eggs . mix in the spaghetti ,
pepper and grated parmesan .

2 . in a medium non-stick skillet , heat the oil over medium flame . add
half of the pasta mixture , spreading it out to the edges like a
pancake . spread the diced mozzarella in a single layer on top , then
layer on the tomatoes , green onions and prosciutto . finish by
spreading the remaining pasta on top and pouring any egg left in the
bowl over it . cook on low until the bottom is browned and crisp ,
about 5 minutes .

3 . when the bottom has set and is golden brown , flip the frittata
over , using either a large spatula or sliding it onto a plate and
then inverting it back into the pan . cook , uncovered , another 5
minutes , or until the bottom is crisp and golden .

4 . to serve , slide the frittata out of the pan . cut into 4 wedges and
sprinkle with chopped parsley . serve warm or at room temperature .
notes :

the italian omelette , known as a frittata , varies from the traditional
french omelette in 3 ways . first , the frittata fillings are beaten in
with the eggs , instead of being folded inside . second , the frittata
may be finished by either flipping over the whole omelette in the
pan , or running it under the broiler . third , as described above ,
whereas the french omelette is folded , the italian frittata is cooked
in one , round piece . both types have their attributes , and preference
is merely a matter of taste .

i am , however , partial to this particular frittata recipe . pasta ,
which can be leftover from a previous meal , is cooked in the eggs
with layers of tomatoes , cheese , seasonings and prosciutto . this is a
wonderfully simple yet absolutely delectable omelette , and it can
even be made in advance . the recipe makes 4 small to medium-size
portions , enough for a light breakfast or first course . if desired ,
add 2 more eggs and increase the other ingredients accordingly for a
heartier , more substantial meal .

never fail sourdough french bread

breads

1 cup hot water
2 tablespoon honey or sugar
2 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 1/2 cup sourdough starter
4 cup ( to 6 ) flour
1 single cake yeast
2 teaspoon salt ( optional )

mix hot water , honey or sugar , butter or margarine in a large ceramic
mixing bowl . cool to lukewarm and add yeast , sourdough starter , salt
and flour a cup at a time enough to make a stiff dough . turn out onto
a floured board and knead for 5 to 8 minutes . place in an oiled bowl
and cover ; let rise until doubled in bulk . punch down and let rise
for 30 minutes . turn dough out onto a floured board and let sit ten
minutes . form into long or round loaf , or into rolls and place in a
well greased pan or cookie sheet and let rise again until doubled .
bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 45 to 55 minutes or until
brown . makes 1 large loaf or 8 to 12 rolls . suggestions : the bread
will rise more quickly if salt is omitted . use only ceramic or wood
bowls and utensils as metal spoils sourdough . ( i use a large
corningware bowl and a plastic whip to mix , then rinse and reuse same
bowl to let kneaded ball rise in ) . wash utensils promptly as this
stuff sets up like cement when left to dry ! this recipe will make 4
thin baguette loaves , two small regular loaves or one monster loaf in
a regular bread pan . grease pans generously with crisco or other
shortening . from the dough boys bakery in san francisco

corn muffins ( samuel )

breads , vegetarian

2 cup corn flour or cornmeal ( yellow or ; blue )
1 cup whole wheat pastry flour
6 oz soft tofu
3 cup water
1/2 teaspoon salt ( sea salt in book )

mix flours . crumble tofu into blender . add boiled water and salt to
tofu in blender ( carefully ) and blend until not quite smooth . ( just a
few pulses please ) . dont do this in too small blender or without lid
like i did once . the goal is muffins , not 2nd degree burns . add
immediately to flour and mix well . spoon into muffin tins or cast
iron stick trays and bake at 400 degrees for about 1/2 hour until
golden brown . she suggests you heat oven first and place oiled muffin
tins in to heat up beforehand to get a `` wonderful crust '' .

please note , i have to oil the tins because i do n't use teflon
products around by birds , but this might work also ... ..this is not
sweet bread , i serve corn potato chowder with it . the corn sticks are
better !

5 to 6 c all-purpose flour or a combi ; nation of
1 all-purpose and whole wheat flours
1 tablespoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon baking soda

cornmeal to sprinkle on pans

the sponge : pour 1 c of starter into a large ceramic mixing bowl .
feed and then refrigerate the remainder . add to the starter in the
mixing bowl , the warm water and about 3 c of flour . beat vigorously
with a spoon or wire whisk . cover this sponge with plastic wrap and
put it aside to work . this time period can be very flexible , but
allow at least 2 hours and as many as 24 . the longer it has , the more
yeast there will be for the second rise and the more pronounced the
sour flavor of the bread will be .

the dough : after sponge has bubbled and expanded , remove plastic wrap .
blend salt , sugar and baking soda into 2 c of flour . mix this into
sponge with large spoon . when dough begins to hold together , turn it
out onto floured board and knead it for 3 or 4 minutes . add flour as
needed to make a fairly stiff dough.give the dough a rest and clean
the bowl . continue kneading for another 3 or 4 minutes . place the
dough back in the bowl turning it to grease the top . cover and let
rise for 2 to 4 hours.if you want , you can skip the second rise in
the bowl and proceed directly to the next step .

shaping and baking the loaves : knock down the dough and shape it into
2 long loaves . place them on a cornmeal sprinkled cookie sheet , cover
and let them rise for another 2 hours or so.toward the end of the
rising period , preheat your oven to 450 f and begin heating a kettle
of water on your stove . just before you put them in the oven , slash
the tops of your loaves diagonally with a knife 1/4 '' deep every two
inches and brush with cold water.place a baking pan on the oven
bottom and put in 3 or 4 cups of boiling water . put the loaves on the
rack over the steaming water , close the oven and bake for about 25
minutes .

tuscan bread

breads , italian

1 oz fresh yeast ; -=or=- instant dry yeast
1 1/4 cup warm water ( 125f )
2 1/4 cup unbleached white flour
1/4 cup whole wheat flour

in a large bowl , dissolve the yeast in the water . mix the 2 flours
and stir them in to make a soft dough . knead 10 minutes by hand , or 4
minutes in a heavy duty mixer with a dough hook . oil a clean bowl and
set the dough in it , cover tightly with plastic wrap and let rise
until doubled in bulk . ( in the traditional warm place , this will take
about 2 hours . however , a cooler temperature will do as long as the
dough has enough time to rise , including overnight in the
refrigerator . ) if the dough is ready sooner than it is needed , punch
it down and refrigerate it or let it rise slowly again at room
temperature until ready to use . rub 2 to 3 tablespoons flour into a
lintless dish towel and set the towel on a baking sheet . when the
dough has completed its rising , punch it down , turn it out onto a
floured work surface , and flatten it into an oblong about 8 inches
wide , 10 inches long , and 1/4-inch thick . it will still be very soft ,
but try to use a minimum of additional flour in handling it . roll the
dough tight , jelly-roll fashion , into a cylindrical shape . flatten
this to about 1-inch thick and roll it again . ( this activates the web
of gluten that will keep the loaf from flattening out in the oven . )
for a round loaf , tuck both ends of the cylinder under to meet in the
center , pinching to seal them . roll the dough around the work surface
under your hands , to shape it into a smooth ball about 5 inches in
diameter . for an oblong loaf , roll the dough under your hands into a
fat cigar shape , extending it to about 10 inches in length . set the
loaf on the floured towel and fold the ends of the towel loosely
around it . put the covered loaf , on its baking sheet , in a warm place
to rise for 1 hour . preheat an oven lined with baking tiles to 400f .
have a water-filled sprayer handy . slide your hand under the towel ,
pick up the loaf , and gently deposit it upside down on the tiles .
spray water into the oven before closing the door , and spray twice
more at 2-minute intervals . bake for 50 minutes or until golden
brown . the bread should have a hollow sound when you knock on its
bottom . makes 1 loaf

oatmeal-rye bread

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
2 1/2 cup warm water ( 110'f . )
1 tablespoon sugar
2 cup rye flour
5 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
1 cup regular rolled oats
1/3 cup firmly packed brown sugar
1 teaspoon salt
1 butter or margarine ( opt )

omar khayyam , whose paradise required only a book of verses , a loaf of
bread , and a jug of wine , might have suffered seriously from
malnutrition ( along with the mysterious thou , who sang beside him ) if
the loaf were the bubble bread we are all familiar with . although
this flabby loaf contains niacin , thiamin , riboflavin , and a rich
assortment of mono- and diglycerides ( ethoxylated and otherwise ) , it
is not especially rich in protien and fiber , two pillars of
contemporary sound diet .

1 . the night before , sprinkle yeast over warm water in a large ( at
least 4-quart ) bowl and let stand for 5 minutes to soften . then add
granulated sugar and rye flour ; beat to blend well . cover bowl
tightly with plastic wrap and let stand at room temperature up to a
day ( at least 12 hours ) . stir in 5 1/4 cups all-purpose flour , rolled
oats , brown sugar , and salt .
2 . to knead by hand , scrape dough onto a board lightly coated with
all-purpose flour . knead , adding flour as required to prevent
sticking , until dough is smooth and elastic , about 10 minutes . place
dough in a greased bowl , turn over to grease top , and cover with
plastic wrap .
3 . to knead with a dough hook , beat until dough pulls cleanly from
bowl . if dough still feels sticky , beat in flour , 1 tablespoon at a
time ; remove dough hook and cover bowl with plastic wrap .
4 . let dough rise in a warm place until doubled , about 1 hour . punch
down and divide into 3 equal portions . shape each portion into a loaf
and set in a greasd 4x8 '' loaf pan . cover loaves lightly and let rise
in a warm place until doubled in volume , about 1 hour . with a sharp
knife or razor blade , slash top of each loaf in about 3 places ,
making cuts about 1/8 '' deep . brush tops lightly with water .
5 . bake in a 350'f . oven ; after 10 minutes , brush tops lightly with
more water . continue baking until loaves are well browned , about 40
minutes total . for a shiny finish , rub tops of hot loaves with soft
butter . invert onto racks . serve warm or cool . if loaves are made
ahead , cool and package airtight up to a day ; freeze to store longer .
make 3 loaves , each about 1
1/2 pounds.

jane burbank 's hushpuppies ( florida cooking )

breads

1 cup self-rising corn meal- ( preferably ; white stone- ground )
1/2 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup pancake mix ( see note )
1 pinch salt
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
1 each egg
1 medium onion , diced
1/2 cup milk , or as needed
1 oil or fish drippings for- frying

hushpuppies are fried in hot drippings left after frying fish ,
picking up some of the fresh fish flavor .

combine the corn meal , flour , pancake mix , salt , sugar , and pepper in
a bowl . beat the egg lightly in a measuring cup , and add the onion
and enough milk to fill to the 1-cup mark . mix the liquids into the
dry mixture well . if not moist throughout , add a tablespoonfull or
two more of milk , blending well .

put any fish drippings you may have in a heavy frying pan and add
enough oil to a depth of 1/4 inch . heat and drop a small amount of
batter into the fat . if it sizzles , the fat is hot enough . make a
test hushpuppy : drop a teaspoonful of batter in ; if it spreads like a
pancake , the batter is too thin , so stir a tablespoonful or two of
corn meal into the uncooked batter . if , after the test hushpuppy has
cooked , it is dense and dry , stir 2 or 3 teasponns of milk into the
batter . when the batter consistency is right , drop the batter from
the tip of a teaspoon into the pan ; cook 6 , 8 , or 10 at a time , being
careful not to let the hushpuppies overlap while frying . cook until
lightly browned , 3 to 4 minutes , turn , and brown the other side ,
about 3 minutes . drain on paper towels and keep hot while frying the
remaining hushpuppies . add more oil to the pan as needed , a little at
a time , to prevent cooking . fat should be kept medium-hot , to brown
hushpuppies . check often so that hushpuppies do not scorch .

note : in florida many like to use self-rising flour and corn meal as
well as pancake mix in hushpuppies and other breads . if you wish ,
substitute all-purpose flour for self-rising and the pancake mix ; use
plain corn meal in place of the self-rising type . then to the dry
ingredients add 1 tablespoon baking powder and 1 teaspoon salt . add
the liquid ingredients , then proceed with the recipe as directed .

cracker tips

breads , crackers

1 each hints and tips

here are a few tips for baking your own crackers : 1 . if you have
cracker dough stored in the freezer , it 's like money
in the bank for spur-of-the-moment entertaining . 2 . baking sheets
lined with parchment paper make easy work of
cleanup . 3 . keep an eye on the oven because baking time may vary
with each
batch , depending on the heat and placement of the sheets . 4 .
crackers store well in airtight containers , but last even better
if frozen . 5 . homemade crackers usually are not as crispy as
commercial
varieties . if they get a little limp hours or days after baking ,
revive them by heating in a 275 degree oven . 6 . to reheat or crisp
crackers , bake on ungreased cookie sheet at 350
degrees for 3-4 minutes .

challah ii~ part 1 of 2

breads , jewish

-- -- dough -- --
1/2 oz yeast ( active ) , dry ( 2 packages )
2 cup water , warm
4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar , granulated
3 large eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil ( up to about 1/4 cup ; more , to taste )
9 cup flour , all-purpose ( more if needed )
-- -- glaze -- --
1 large egg
1 sesame or poppy seeds

mix yeast in warm water . let sit 5 minutes . in a large bowl combine
salt , sugar , eggs and oil . add yeast mixture . slowly add flour ,
stirring until not too sticky . when the dough becomes too thick to
stir , turn it out onto a floured board and knead , adding flour as
necessary . scrape the working surface with a plastic dough spatula
from time to time , to keep a dry skin from forming on it . you may
find that you need more flour , but do n't add too much more , or the
dough will become heavy . knead until the dough is smooth and elastic
( about 10 minutes ) .

form dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled large bowl ,
turning to coat the dough with oil . a ceramic bowl is best . cover
the bowl with a clean cloth and leave in a warm , draft-free place to
rise for 1 1/2 hours , or until doubled in bulk . after the dough has
risen , punch it down and divide it into 6 balls . let the dough balls
sit for 5 minutes , covered .

keeping dough balls covered while working , remove a ball and roll it
between your hands ( or on working surface ) into a cord about 1 inch
wide by about 20 inches long . the dough is quite elastic , making it
nicely workable , yet also tending to make it shrink back slightly
after being lengthened . i find it best to lengthen it in a series of
passes . form 3 cords this way , and then start from the middle and
braid them into a single loaf . tuck the ends under . it 's a little
harder to figure out how to start braiding from the middle , but the
loaves come out more even and attractive that way . do n't pull the
cords while braiding . place the loaf on a lightly oiled baking sheet ,
and cover it with a cloth while you form the other loaf . keep the
loaves well apart on the baking sheet , since they will expand a lot .
cover the loaves and place again into a warm , draft-free place to
rise for 45-60 minutes .

after the loaves have risen , gently brush the tops with beaten egg
using a soft brush , and then sprinkle with the seeds . bake at 350
degrees f. for 30 minutes , or until golden brown .

biscuits supreme

biscuits

2 cup flour
4 teaspoon baking powder
2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup shortening
2/3 cup milk

preheat oven to 450 degrees f. stir together the flour , baking powder ,
sugar , cream of tartar and salt . cut in the shortening until the mixture
resembles coarse crumbs .

make a well in the center . pour in the milk all at once . stir just until
dough clings together ; no more .

knead gently on a lightly floured surface for 10-12 strokes . roll or pat
to about 1/2-inch thickness . cut with a ( about ) 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter ,
dipping the cutter into flour before each cut .

transfer to an ungreased baking sheet . bake in a 450 degrees f oven for
10-12 minutes , or until golden .

lots of cookbooks tell you to use two knives , or some such , to do the
cutting-in of the first step . forks work fine for me ( i 'm a klutz . )

all of the trick to making light , fluffy biscuits is in how you handle
them : the less , the better . you can make these as drop biscuits ( skip the
rolling ; drop batter by tablespoons , and bake ) ; they 're even better for the
lack of handling .

outside north america you might not know what shortening is . use butter ,
margarine , copha or lard . vegetable shortening really is better for this
recipe , but do n't forget lots of butter to put *on* them ... . i make these
for study breaks . they disappear at an exponential rate ... .

notes :

* simple , fluffy biscuits -- this originated in `` the better homes and
gardens cookbook , '' which i consider basic equipment for genteel
middle-class living . here `` biscuits '' is the north american meaning of the
word and not the commonwealth meaning of the word . in england these would
be called `` scones . '' yield : makes 10-12 .

: difficulty : easy .
: time : 10 minutes preparation , 10 minutes baking .

grape starter

breads

-- -- cooking with master chefs -- --
-- -- first day -- --
1/2 lb stemmed red grapes
2 cup bread flour
2 1/2 cup water
-- -- three days before using -- --
1 cup flour
1 cup water
-- -- two days before using -- --
1 cup flour
1 cup water
-- -- one day before using -- --
1 cup flour
1 cup water

it takes 10 days to complete but is then yours for life . wrap the
grapes in well washed cheesecloth , tieing the corners to form a bag ;
lightly crush them with a rolling pin ( to release the sugar to mix
with the natural yeast on the skins ; just like making wine ! ) and
immerse them in the flour water mix . cover tightly with a lid or
plastic wrap secured with a rubber band . leave at room temperature
for 6 days , stirring once or twice a day for the six days .

the bag of grapes will eventually appear inflated , and liquid will
begin to separate from the flour base . the mixture will begin to
taste and smell slightly fruity , and the color will be strange . that
is as it should be . by the sixth day the bag of grapes will have
deflated , the color will be yellow , and the taste pleasantly sour ;
the fermentation is complete . the starter is living but weak , and it
needs to be fed .

remove the grapes and squeeze their juices back into the starter .
stir it up thouroughly and transfer it to a clean container .
( although you can use it after just one feeding , the starter will be
stronger and healthier with the full treatment ) you can refrigerate
it until you 're ready to proceed .

three days before you plan to use it , stir 1 cup flour and 1 cup
water into the container , blending well . let stand uncovered at room
temperature until it bubbles up - 3 to 4 hours - then cover and
refrigerate . repeat this for the second and third day .

store the starter tightly covered in the refrigerator where it will
keep perfectly for 4 to 6 months.- after which it 's a good idea to
pour off all but 2 cups and give it another feeding . before using the
stored starter for bread , however , give it the full 3-day feeding
schedule once again to restore it and to tone down excess sourness .

sylvia 's comments : i bought a big bunch of black grapes for this
( did n't remember that the recipe called for red grapes ) and put them
into 2 cheesecloth packages , which made cramming them into the
container a bit difficult . i was n't sure how much to crush the
grapes , so only used a little pressure with my hands , just enough to
dampen the cheesecloth with grape juice . later note : i should have
crushed more , after 6 days the grapes were still pretty intact . i
squeezed everything i could out of one of my packets and threw it
away , crushed the other more thoroughly and stuck in back in the
starter .

cheryl 's sourdough starter

breads , sourdough

-- -- cheryl gavard -- --
1 cup milk
1 tablespoon sugar salt
2 cup flour
1 tablespoon white vinegar

mix all together , and let sit on your counter for 3 days with a loose
fitting lid or cover with saran wrap . on the third day stir it well .
let sit for two more days . some recipes call for adding 1 packet of
yeast that has been dissolved in 1/2 cup warm water on the fifth day .
it sort of speeds up the process of it getting sour . if you do add
it , then let the mix sit out for at least one more week , stirring it
every day . if you do n't add it , you still have to let it sit out a
week , but , it may not be as sour the first few times you use it .
store starter in the fridge . it will separate , into two parts , a
darkish liquid on the top ~ this is normal . before you use it , stir
the liquid back into the bottom part . always use a wooden or plastic
spoon . never use metal . always use glass , ceramic or plastic
bowls ... never metal . to use : pour out the amount needed . for 1/2
cup starter used , feed with 1/2 cup flour and 1 teaspoon sugar . stir
in well . do n't worry about flour lumps etc . let sit out on the
counter with a loose lid overnight ! stir , return to refrigerator .
( according to cheryl & connie , you have to wait at least 3 or 4 days
between used ! ) if you do n't use within a week , feed starter 1
teaspoon sugar , stir in and return to fridge . it 's not that
hard ... and of all the starters i 've used , this one so far has been
the best . thanks cheryl and connie ! repost by sallie kratz nxmb21a

homade pita bread

breads

1 cup water
1 cup apple juice
1 1/2 tablespoon yeast , active dry
1/2 teaspoon salt
5 cup whole wheat flour
6 teaspoon whole-wheat gluten ( opt )
1 yellow cornmeal

1 . in saucepan , combine water and apple juice and heat just until
warm ( about 115 deg ) . put warm liquid in large mixing bowl , sprinkle
yeast over liquid and allow to dissolve . add 2 cups flour and the 6
eeaspoons whole-wheat gluten flour , if desired ; beat at medium speed
of electric mixer for 3 minutes . cover and let rise in warm place
until doubled in size , about 20 min .

2 . add salt , beat in as much flour as can be beaten vigorously by
hand for 6 minutes . mix as much remaining flour as can be handled
when mixing by hand and enough so that dough can be removed from bowl
onto floured surface . cover with a towel and let rest for
10 min .

3 . knead gently and rhythmically for 10-15 minutes .
keeping dough rolled in a ball . add the remaining flour , a little at
a time , kneading after each addition . be careful not to add too much
flour , or the bread will be dry . keep dough slightly sticky to the
touch . cover with a towel and let rest 10 minutes .

4 . at this point , the dough may be shaped into pita bread . loaves of
bread , pizza dough , buns , etc . to make pitas , cut dough in half with
lightly floured hands , roll each half into rope 2 1/2 inches in
diameter . cut each roll into pieces and roll with hands into 2 to 3
inch balls , depending on the desired size of pocked bread .

5 . place each dough ball on flat surface and with a lightly floured
rolling pin , roll out from center until dough forms a circle 1/4 inch
thick . gently dip bottom of dough in cornmeal and place on back of
cookie sheet . cover with a towel and let rise at room tempeerature
for 15 minutes .

6 . the best way to bake pitas is on flat quarry tiles , which can be
purchased at any rock and stone outlet .
a cast ironskillet turned upside down also works well , but limits
you to making one pita at a time . a thrid option , less satisfactory
than the others but still workable , is a cookie sheet turned upside
down .

7 . place one of the three items mentioned above in the oven and
preheat to 500 degrees . remove top oven rack for convenience in
removing pitas later .

8 . gently but quickly slip a raised pita onto a spatula and place it
on the hot tile , skillet or cookie sheet . once it touches the hot
surface , you can not move it , so aim carefull . repeat with as many
pitas as your baking method will accomodate . close oven and bake for
3-4 minutes or until lightly browned . if your baking the pitas on a
cookie sheet you may see very few or perhaps no bubbles appear - do
not overcook just because bubbles are small and not uniform . if
you 're using tiles or a cast iron skillet , you will be able to watch
pockets form immediately .

9 . remove pitas carefully from oven with spatula and place on cooling
rack . cut each pita in half while still warm . if difficult to cut .
place pita in a damp towel for 5 minutes , and then it will cut nicely .

10 . to store : place in plastic bags , 3 or 4 to a bag , while still
slightly warm to keep soft . may be frozen .

bannock - scottish

breads , canadian

1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoon sugar , granulated
2 teaspoon baking powder salt
2 tablespoon butter , melted
1/3 cup raisins ; optional water ; approx ,

`` bannock , a simple type of scone was cooked in pioneer days over open
fires . variations in flours and the additional of dried or fresh
fruit make this bread the simple choice of canadian campers even
today . oven baking has become an acceptable alternative to the cast
iron frypan . mckelvie 's restaurant in halifax serves an oatmeal
version similar to this one . for plain bannock , omit rolled oats and
increase the all purpose flour to 1 cup ... . one of the earliest quick
breads , bannock was as simple as flour , salt , a bit of fat ( often
bacon grease ) and water . in gold rush days , dough was mixed right in
the prospector 's flour bag and cooked in a frypan over an open fire .
indians wrapped a similar dough around sticks driven into the ground
beside their camp fire , baking it along with freshly caught fish .
today 's native _fried bread_ is like bannock and cooked in a skillet .
newfoundlander 's _damper dogs_ are small rounds of dough cooked on
the stove 's dampers while _toutons_ are similar bits of dough deep
fried . at a promotional luncheon for the 1992 inuit circumpolar
conference , eskimo doughnuts , deep fried rings of bannock dough , were

breads , ethnic

1/4 cup water ( 110 to 115 f . )
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 pkg dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water ( 110 to 115 degrees f . )
1 tablespoon olive oil ( room temperature )
1 1/2 cup unbleached flour
1 additional flour
1 additional water

hand method :

pour the first 1/4 cup of water into a medium bowl and add the
sugar and salt , stirring to dissolve the sugar . sprinkle the yeast
over the water mixture , stirring once to blend and let sit for 5
minutes until the top is bubbly and the yeast has bloomed . stir in
the remaining warm water and the oil . place the flour in a large
bowl and add the water and oil mixture to it . stir , adding enough
flour to make a soft dough that will pull away from the sides of the
bowl . if it is too dry , add a little water a tbls at a time .

turn the dough out on a well-floured work surface , sprinkle the top
with a little additional flour . knead until it become very springy ,
elastic and very smooth . it should be light in weight , if it is
heavy , you have use too much flour and it will not raise properly .
form into a smooth ball and let rest on the work surface while you
wash and clean the large bowl . spray with a non-stick spray . put the
ball of dough into the bowl and turn it over to get some of the spray
on the top . cover with plastic wrap or a warm , damp , clean dishtowel .
let the dough rise in a warm , draft free place until double in
volume , about 1 1/2 to 2 hours .

if the dough rises before you are ready , punch it down in the bowl by
kneading making sure all of the air is gone . turn it over and reshape
it into a ball and let rise again . if the top is dry , use a little
olive oil to grease it . you can punch the dough down and cover the
bowl and keep the dough refrigerated for up to two days before
letting it rise at room temperature .

for a thin , crisp pizza crust punch the dough down and turn out and
spread over a pizza pan or baking sheet or a bakers peel . cover with
filling and topping , baking at once .

for thicker , softer pizza crust punch the dough down and turn out
shaping as above and then cover lightly with a clean dishtowel . let
rise about 30 minutes before covering with filling and topping .

makes enough dough for one 12 to 14 inch round pizza , two 7 to 8-
inch round pizzas or one oblong pizza , or one dozen appetizer-sized
pizzas .

1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
2 cup buttermilk or sweet milk

mix the whole wheat flour throughly with the white flour , salt , and
soda .

make a well in the center and gradually mix in the liquid . stir with a
wooden spoon . you may need lass , or more liquid - it depends on the
absorbent quality of the flour . the dough should be soft but
managable .

hands . put on a lightly floured baking sheet and with the palm of
your hand flatten out in a circle 1 1/2 inches thick . with a knife
dipped in flour , make a cross through the center of the bread so that
it will easily break into quarters when it is baked .

bake at 425 degrees for 25 minutes , reduce the heat to 350 degrees
and bake a further 15 minutes .

if the crust seems too hard , wrap the baked bread in a damp tea cloth .
leave the loaf standing upright until it is cool .

the bread should not be cut until it has set - about 6 hours after it
comes out of the oven .

lacking this , you could also use 2 teaspoons .

preheat oven to 425f . place the water , butter , salt and pepper in a
small saucepan and bring to a boil . immediately remove from the heat
( do not allow it to boil for any length of time ) and add the flour
all at once . stir with a wooden spoon until a ball forms . return to
medium heat to dry the paste . flatten the paste on the bottom of the
pan , bring it up to the side of the pan nearest you , then flop it
over to the opposite side of the pan . continue until butter starts
oozing out in bubbles , about 5 minutes . when pinched , the paste
should not stick to your fingers . remove from the heat and wait 5
minutes until slightly cooled , then beat in the eggs one at a time ,
waiting until each is incorporated before adding the next . add the
cheese and mustard . butter a baking sheet , then rinse under cold
water , or place parchment paper on the baking sheet . pipe out small
dots , about 1/2-inch in diameter , leaving enough room for them to
triple in size . brush with beaten egg or milk , sprinkle with more
cheese , and bake for 15 minutes . lower the heat to 400f , open the
oven door briefly to let the steam escape and then bake for an
additional 10 minutes . cool on a rack . gougeres freeze well .

maryetta 's italian sausage bread

breads , clay pot

1 lb italian sausage , sweet
1 1/4 cup water ; lukewarm
1 teaspoon salt
1 pkg dry active yeast
1 pinch saffron
1 tablespoon fennel seeds
4 cup all-purpose flour ; sifted
5 teaspoon olive oil
1 cornmeal

if you think your sausage has too much fat , simmer in shallow water
in a frying pan , pricking the sausage with a sharp knife to allow the
fat to escape .

combine the lukewarm water , salt , yeast , saffron , and fennel seeds in
a metal cup and maintain a lukewarm temperature to keep the yeast
active . sift the flour into a large bowl , and make a well in the
center of it . pour in the yeast mixture and mix well ( you will have
to use your hands ) . knead the dough until smooth and elastic ( about
10 minutes ) , then pour the oil over the dough and knead until no
longer sticky ( about 5 minutes ) . place in a large bowl , cover with a
towel , and put in a warm place until it doubles in size . ( press the
dough with your fingertips ; if they leave a stubborn imprint , it has
risen enough . )

when the rising time is almost over , presoak a clay pot , top and
bottom , for 15 minutes .

roll the dough out to a thickness of 1/4 inch . place the sausages
( about 5 ) on top of the dough , wrap each in its own pocket , and pinch
the ends closed . place each pocket side by side to form one loaf .
trim a piece of aluminum foil , cover the bottom of the bottom of the
presoaked pot and sprinkle with cornmeal . add the dough to the pot
and put lid on , then put the covered pot in a warm place and let the
dough rise until doubled in size ( about 60 minutes ) .

cover the pot and place it in a cold oven .

set the oven temperature at 450 degrees f .

bake for 45 minutes , then check the bread and let it continue baking ,
uncovered , in the oven to brown for an additional 15 minutes ( total
cooking time about 60 minutes ) . the bread will be done when a finger
thump on the loaf 's surface sounds hollow .

allow the bread to sit for 15 to 20 minutes before serving .

note : this recipe can be safely doubled , but use 2 pots for cooking .

warning :

use only canning jars for this recipe . others may not be tempered to
withstand the heat . do not use coffee or vegetable cans as most
contain lead and are painted or sealed with materials that may give
off toxic gases when heated .

taken from `` better homes and gardens new crockery cooker ''

this recipe does n't say you can seal them up and store them in your
pantry but my kerr canning book recipe says you can ; here 's how :

remove jars from the oven one at a time , wipe rim of jar clean ; put
on lid and ring and screw on tightly .

jars will seal as the cake cools . store like canned goods .

if you 'll be giving these as gifts , take a piece of decorative cloth
( about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid or as large as
you 'd like ) and put it on top of the lid , then screw on the ring .
make sure you screw the lid on very tightly . i like to use pinking
shears to cut the cloth out with .

biscuit bonanza

breads

-- -- ~biscuit bonanza in -- --

france , dessert is often constructed from towers of flaky puff
pastry , and in the middle east , paper-thin phyllo dough is either
left crispy or made soggy with syrup . but the u.s. has biscuits to
call its own . biscuits -- moist , tender and rich -- are used as an
alternative to a yeast-leavened bread . biscuits are closer in
technique to making pie crust than to making bread . the steps follow
the same order : cut the shortening into the flour mixture , add some
liquid and roll it out . once you 've mastered the technique , you can
not only delight in the aroma of biscuits browning for breakfast , you
can also bake scones for a proper english tea . ( the difference is
there are eggs in scones and not in biscuits ) . biscuits are similar
to real shortcakes , rather than the hockey pucks made from cellulose
sponges found next to the red glop in the produce department . and you
can crown fresh fruit with a biscuit dough topping and call it a
cobbler . start by sifting the dry ingredients ~-flour , baking powder
or soda , salt , sugar and so forth . then cut in the butter or
shortening until the mixture resembles a fine meal , like breadcrumbs .
while a wire-blade pastry blender is useful , you can use two knives ,
pulse a food processor fitted with the steel blade on and off a few
times , or use your fingertips . the third step is adding the liquid .
the trick is to accomplish this quickly , so that the ingredients are
just blended enough to hold together . it 's tempting to do more , but
that 's what makes biscuits or their first cousins tough . once liquid
is added to flour the gluten formation begins , and any agitation
intensifies this process . turn the dough out onto a well-floured
surface , such as a counter or a pastry board , and use the same
restraint that went into adding the liquid . do n't knead it more than
10 times , just enough to give it a push in the oven , but not enough
to make it chewy . now either roll or pat the dough into the proper
thickness . the dough should be less than 1 in thick . cut it into
desired shapes . no fancy cutters ? use juice cans ( a 2 in diameter ) or
an upside down glass .

jewish `` corn '' bread

breads , sourdough , jewish

1 1/2 cup water , warm ( 110 degree )
1 pkg yeast , dry
1/2 teaspoon sugar
4 teaspoon salt
3 cup rye sourdough starter
1 measured after stirring down
1 at room temperature .
2 cup flour , gluten
3 1/2 cup flour , all-purpose or as
1 needed .
1 cornmeal ( for sprinkling
1 the baking sheets )
1 glaze :
1 egg white beaten with 2 tbs
1 water .
1 optional topping :
2 teaspoon chernushka ( black caraway )
1 seeds .

you can buy chernushka `` black caraway '' in some health food stores or
from mail-order . they are nothing like the familiar caraway seeds .
this bread is a new york specialty , usually made in bakeries .

1 . combine 1/2 cup of the warm water , the yeast and sugar and let
stand until doubled in bulk , about 10 minutes .
2 . dissolve the salt
in the remaining warm water in a mixing bowl . mix in the sourdough
starter , then the yeast mixture , then the gluten flour and 2 cups of
the all-purpose flour ; make a soft dough .
3 . spread 1 1/2 cups flour
on the kneading surface and turn the dough out onto it . knead , adding
more flour if necessary to make a soft dough that will hold its
shape . do not overknead.. the dough should be only slightly elastic ,
even a bit sticky .
4 . form the dough into a ball and put in an
ungreased bowl ; cover with plastic , and let rise until doubled in
bulk , about 1 1/2 hours .
5 . turn the dough out onto a lightly flour
surface and knead it a few strokes to expel air . cover with a towel
and let rest for 15 minutes .
6 . divide the dough in half . form each
half into a loaf by flattening in to an inch-thick oval about 12
inches long , then rolling it up from one long side . pinch the seam
closed . shape the ends of the oval loaves neatly and plce them on two
cornmeal-dusted baking sheets , seam down . cover with towels and let
rise until `` three-quarters proofed , '' or not fully doubled .
7 . while the loaves are rising , set a large roasting pan containing 2
inches of boiling water on the oven floor ( or the lowest shelf of an
electric oven ) and preheat the oven to 400 degrees .
8 . brush the
loaves with egg-white glaze , being careful not to let the glaze drip
onto the pan , as it sticks and burns . with a single-edged razor
blade or a small , sharp knife , cut three diagonal slashes , holding
the blade almost parallel to the surface , about 1/4 inch deep on each
loaf . sprinkle the loaves with `` black caraway '' or caraway seeds , if
you like .
9 . bake for 30 minutes on the middle and upper shelves of
the oven , then brush again with glaze , exchange shelf positions , and
remove the water pan . bake for 20 to 30 minutes longer , or until
there is a hollow sound when you rap the bottom of the loaf .
10 . cool the bread on racks .

settin ' 'round bread

breads

1/4 cup water ( at 105 degrees )
1/3 cup turbinado sugar ( most any sugar wil ; l do , though )
2 pkg yeast ( dry ) , active
1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup shortening
1 1/2 cup water
1/2 cup milk
1 large egg
1 cup dry milk , non-fat
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 teaspoon honey
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon , ground
1/2 cup rolled oats
1/2 cup cornmeal
1/4 cup bran
1/4 cup cracked wheat
1/4 cup buckwheat
1/2 cup soy flour
1 cup rye flour
2 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
3 cup white flour
1 butter

melt the shortening and the butter . let them cool a bit , so as not to kill
the yeast when they are added to the dough . if you want to scald the milk ,
do so , and also let it cool ( it is common practice to scald milk before
baking with it , though i never do . )

dissolve the yeast and sugar in the 1/4 cup of lukewarm water .

mix the cinnamon , oats , corn meal , bran , cracked wheat , buckwheat , soy
flour and rye flour . add the rest of the water , the milk , butter ,
shortening , egg and honey , and mix well . stir in the dissolved yeast
mixture . mix in the salt and the whole wheat flour .

stir in the white flour , about 1/2 cup at a time , until the mixture is
stiff enough to knead . you 'll probably have about half of it left .

remove the dough from the mixing bowl , onto a floured surface . knead the
dough , adding more white flour as necessary to keep the dough workable .
knead the dough until it is smooth and elastic , about ten minutes . it 's
okay if you end up using less than or more than the three cups of white
flour ; just use whatever it takes .

put the dough back into a bowl that 's been very lightly greased . let it
rise , covered , in a still , warm place ( around 85 degrees f. is best , though
room temperature will work ) for 45 minutes , or until it has doubled in
bulk .

punch the dough down , divide in half , shape into loaves and place each half
into a loaf pan which has been very lightly greased . let rise again , for
another 45 minutes , in a still , warm place , until the loaves have about
doubled in bulk .

preheat the oven to 350 degrees f. as the bread finishes rising . bake the
bread for 35-40 minutes , until it sounds hollow when tapped . remove from
the loaf pans and rub the top of the loaves with some butter to give them a
nice , soft , chewy crust .

1/4 teaspoon salt ; or to taste
1/2 teaspoon black pepper ; coarsely ground or cracke
2 teaspoon lemon rind ; freshly grated
3 each egg whites ; lightly beaten

*anne 's note : i 'd omit the salt to reduce the sodium

`` these delicious popovers take advantage of lemon 's strong affinity
with freshly ground black pepper . they rise best in baked in deep
molds in a very hot oven . one of the best ways to grate lemon peel is
to remove the zest in strips using a vegetable peeler , then grind it
to a powder in a spice mill . ''

preheat oven to 450f . sift the flour into a mixing bowl and gradually
whisk in the milk . add the remaining ingredients , whisking just to
mix . the mixture should be the consistency of heavy cream . if
necessary , add more milk . grease popover molds or muffin cups with
vegetable oil spray or a little olive oil . fill each mold 1/2 full .
bake for 15 minutes without opening the door . reduce heat to 375f and
continue baking for 20 to 25 minutes , or until the popovers are
browned . unmold and serve at once .

1/4 cup butter
1/4 cup lemon juice
2 eggs
1/4 to 1/2 tsp lemon peel

source : natl cooking echo 19 jun 90

contributed to the echo by : debra heng

i have n't made these lemon ones yet , but i scaled down a larger
recipe from some cookbook to resemble the pecan tassie proportions ,
hoping to have enough lemon filling for a batch of tartlets . so it
may or may not be enough , thought i 'd let ya know .

lemon tassie filling

in a small saucepan over low heat , cook the 1 st three until
dissolved . beat the eggs with a mixer and add the hot mix very
slowly , mixing constantly . then return mix to the saucepan and cook
for about 3 minutes until it 's of pudding consistency . stir in lemon
peel . let cool to room temp . fill each tartlet with about 2 tsps of
the lemon mix . bake at 350 f for 20-25 mins. , or until golden .

the back of the tart tamper package also suggested some other
fillings , like cherry or blueberry pie filling , or vanilla pudding
topped afterwards with a strawberry or a few blueberries ( glaze with
some heated currant jelly ) .

sourdough basics from starter to finish

breads , sourdough

1 info

`` those hot griddlecakes the forty-niners forked from the frying pan
before setting out to dig for gold were , no doubt , sourdough
pancakes . the hot biscuits so treasured by cowboys riding the dusty
trail were most likely sourdough biscuits . the life sustaining bread
baked by pioneer women in crude stone ovens was probably sourdough
bread . after the california gold rush , when the klondike prospectors
sailed from san francisco to alaska , they carried precious sourdough
starter with them - and ever since sourdough bread has been
assiciated with san francisco . and in alaska , a prospector with a pot
of sourdough strapped to his back was quickly nicknamed a `` sourdough '' .

`` as the population swelled westward during the last century , the
practice of keeping a small amopunt of yesterday 's dough alive to
`` start '' tomorrow 's bread was carried from one coast to the next , just
as it had been carried from the old world to the new . archaeologists
claim that leavened bread was first developed around 4,000 b.c. , when
using starters must have been the only way to accomplish leavening .
surely ancient bakers guarded their supplies zealously , just as
thousands of years later propectors would tuck the sourdough pot into
their bedroll at night to keep it warm and safe .

`` to this day , the distinctive flavor of so many european and russian
breads , as well as the famous san francisco version of sourdough
bread , is derived from the use of a sourdough starter . a starter is
simply a self-perpetuating yeast mixture . traditionally it was made
by mixing flour and water with a cooked potato or fruit such as wine
grapes or ripe bananas . organisms in the flour and the germenting
fruit attracted the wild yeast spores ubiquitous in an unpollouted
environment , and a starter was easy to begin . today , this method is
not always reliable owing to variables such as chlorinated water and
pesticide treated flour , fruits and vegetables .

`` we 've developed an easy sourdough starter by combining unbleached
all-purpose flour , bakers active dry yeast , and water . with minimal
care , the starter can be maintained for years and stored in the
refrigerator ( see box ) . since yeast is a single-cell fungus , its
metabolic activity causes fermentation . as the yeast cells multiply
and feed on the carbohydrates in the flour - which in turn give off
carbon dioxide , alcohol and other compounds - the ongoing activity
gives the sourdough starter its sour aroma and tart flavor .

`` keeping a pot of sourdough going in your refrigerator opens up all
sorts of possibilities . breads have an assertive tang and keep
longer than other home-baked breads . biscuits share the same
distinctive flavor and are moist and fluffy . sourdough pancakes have
a delicate texture and a subtle flavor that your family will clamor
for on sunday mornings . we 're sure that once you begin baking with
sourdough , you will become a convert for life .

`` sourdough starter maintenance

`` o using and maintaining a sourdough starter is a cyclical process ;
you must always replace what you remove from the crock . if well
maintained , a sourdough culture will last a lifetime . each time you
take a portion of the starter for a recipe , replace that amount with
equal quantities of water and flour . for example , if you remove 1 cup
of starter to make sourdough country bread , you must replace it with
1 cup of lukewarm water ( 100f ) and 1 cup of unbleached all-purpose
flour . whisk these ingredients into the starter until blended but not
completely smooth . any remaining lumps will dissolve as the mixture
ferments . cover and leave the starter at room temperature for at
least 12 hours or overnight . the starter is now ready to be used
again , or can be refrigerated .

`` o use a 2-quart non-metal crock or bowl to store the starter . this
wat , the replenishing starter ingredients can be mixed directly in
the storage container .

`` o maintain the starter by stirring it at least once a week . this
invigorates the yeast and expels some of the alcohol . if you do not
use the starter every two weeks or so , refresh it by removing 1 cup
of the starter ( give it to a friend or discard it ) , and adding 1 cup
of unbleached all-purpose flour and 1 cup of lukewarm ( 100f ) water .
whisk until blended . cover and leave at room temperature 12 hours or
overnight before returning it to the refrigerator .

`` o if you plan to be away or know you will not use the starter
frequently , freeze it in a sterilized , air-tight freeezer container .
thaw the starter two days before you plan on baking with it ,
transferring it to a 2 quart non-metal storage container . refresh
the starter withg 1 cup each of water and flour . cover and leave at
room temperature for 12 hours or overnight before using . it 's a good
idea to freeze the starter in two containers ; you can keep the second
one frozen indefinitely to serve as a backup should anything happen
to the thawed starter . ''

rosemary olive oil bread

breads

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 cup water -- 105-115 degrees
2 cup basic bread sponge
3 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1 extra virgin olive oil --
1 for brushing
3 cup unbleached all-purpose
1 flour
1/3 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
1 for kneading
1/2 cup whole wheat flour --
1 preferably organic
1/4 cup fresh rosemary -- finely
1 chopped
2 tablespoon kosher salt
1 cornmeal -- for sprinkling

measure the rosemary *after* chopping .

preheat the oven to 400 degrees . place the walnuts on a baking sheet ,
roasting until fragrant and golden brown , about eight minutes . cool .

in a bowl , dissolve the yeast in the water . allow to proof for three
minutes .

stir the sponge and 3 tablespoons oil into the water , breaking the
sponge up using your hands or a spoon . stir in the rosemary and salt .

add 3 cups of the unbleached flour , the whole wheat flour , and salt
and mix , scraping and folding until the dough gathers into a single
mass which will be wet and sticky with strands hanging from your
fingers .

turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and allow to rest
for 3 minutes . knead in as much of the 1/3 cup of flour as is
required to make a smooth , elastic and only slightly sticky dough
( use as little flour as is possible ) . shape into a ball .

place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl , brush the top of the dough
with additional oil , and cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate
overnight .

remove from the refrigerator and allow to warm-up in a draft-free
spot for two hours .

sprinkle a baking sheet without sides generously with cornmeal . on a
floured work surface , halve the dough and then shape one piece into a
ball , pressing to remove any large bubbles at the edges . place the
dough-ball on the baking sheet , being sure to put the seam on the
bottom . repeat with the second ball , leaving 3 to 4 inches between
the two . cover with plastic and allow to rise until doubled , in a
draft-free location . this should take 2-2 1/2 hours . these loaves
will be flat and wide .

preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425 . place a baking pan with
decent sides on the bottom shelf . boil two cups of water . brush the
loaves again with oil and then , using a razor blade , make a
tic-tac-toe pattern in the top of each of the loaves - do not tear
the dough , you want to cut it . pour the boiling water into the baking
pan . slide the loaves off the sheet and onto the stone .

bake for 20 minutes , reduce the temperature to 350 and then bake for
another 30-35 minutes until the loaves are a light golden brown and
hollow sounding when tapped on the bottom . when done , brush with
additional olive oil and transfer to cool on a rack .

rye sourdough starter

breads , sourdough , jewish

1 pkg dry yeast
3 cup water , tepid ( 80-degree )
3 1/2 cup flour , rye medium
1 onion , small , peeled and
1 halved .

the 4-cup batch of starter made by this recipe is enough to bake any
of the rye breads requiring a rye starter , with enough left over to
serve as the nucleus for another baking . when you `` feed '' leftover
starter ... which should be done every 2 weeks or so.. add a little
rye flour and water , using 3 parts of flour to 2 of water . to build
up a small amount of starter to a quantity large enough for baking ,
do the job in several steps , never adding a larger measure of flour
than the amount of starter on hand . let the starter stand at room
temperature overnight or for up to 24 hours , until it is bubbly and
no longer smells floury . to increase further , add more flour and
water in the same proportions and again let the starter ferment until
it is bubbly enough to use . store leftover starter in the
refrigerator between bakings and `` feedings , '' and for indefinite
storage , freeze it . thaw , then feed the starter and let it ferment at
room temperature before use . makes about 4 cups .

1 . dissolve the yeast in 2 cups of the tepid water , then beat in 2
cups of the rye flour , beating until no lumps remain . add the onion ,
cover loosely with a cloth , and let stand at room temperature for 24
hours . 2 . remove the onion . beat in 1 cup tepid water , then 1 1/2
cups rye flour . cover with the cloth and let stand for 24 hours
longer . the starter should now be pleasantly sour-smelling , almost
beery , and bubbly . ( depending upon the temperature of the room , a
slightly longer or shorter period of fermentation may produce this
result . ) to use : the starter is now ready for use and can be
refrigerated for up to 24 hours before use , without further feeding .
if you must hold the starter longer before use , the night before it
is wanted , add 1/2 cup tepid water and 3/4 cup rye flour and let is
stand at room temperature overnight .

challah ii~ part 2 of 2

breads , jewish

1 see part 1

: continued from part 1

notes :

* challah ( pronounced `` hallah '' ) is a type of braided egg bread
traditionally eaten on the jewish sabbath . it is eaten by tearing off
hunks rather than by cutting with a knife .

i got this recipe from a housemate a couple of years ago ; i do n't
know its origins before that , but it has become one of my favorite
recipes , and one with which i have experimented a good deal . i 've
tried several other challah recipes , but find i like this one the
best . yield : 2 large loaves .

* the variation in oil makes quite a difference in the moisture of
the bread : if you use the larger quantity , the bread comes out very
nice and moist , but when it cools it becomes somewhat oily .

the amounts of sugar and oil may sound high , but try it this way once
before cutting back . i have tried other recipes that use less , and
they do n't taste nearly as good .

* here 's the fun part -- > variations . because this dough is so
workable , you can form it many different ways , limited only by your
imagination ; i once made a whole collection of different shapes and
sizes , for a festive dinner party .

some of the variations i have tried include :

: o adding extra ingredients , such as raisins and/or nuts
: o forming the braided loaf into a wreath-like loop ( joining the
ends ) : o braiding 5 ways instead of 3
: o baking a small loaf on top of a larger loaf ( traditional )
: o braiding 3 braided loaves into a recursive loaf ( did n't turn out
well ; it ended up looking knotty , rather than intricate , and being
somewhat tough )
: o varying the loaf sizes . one time i made individual-sized
loaves , so that everyone could have their own loaf at dinner . another
time , i divided the dough into 2 halves , set one aside , and made a
loaf out of the other half . then , i divided the remaining piece into
2 halves , and continued the process until i had an array of loaves ,
each half the size of the previous . i managed to get 9 loaves by
doing this , the smallest of which was about 1/4 inch by about 2
inches .

: o varying the length-to-width proportions ; traditionally , challah
loaves are quite wide relative to their length . i find that shorter ,
wider loaves are doughier ( and thus tastier ) , but longer loaves look
more elegant .

: difficulty : moderate .
: time : 30 minutes dough preparation , 1 1/2 hours first rising , 1
hour loaf forming , 1 hour second rising , 30 minutes baking . total : 4
1/2 hours . : precision : approximate measurement ok .

best : biscuit mix

biscuits , mix

9 cup cake-and-pastry flour
1 cup skim milk powder
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1/4 cup baking powder
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 lb shortening

in large bowl , stir together flour , milk powder , sugar , baking
powder , salt and baking soda . using pastry blender , cut in shortening
until mixture is in fine crumbs . transfer to airtight container ;
store in refrigerator for up to 2 months .

stir well before using .

[ crisco golden variety shortening adds colour and flavour . ]

see `` best : golden tea biscuit '' for use of mix .

biscuit tips :

1 . when measuring large quantities of dry ingredients , measure each
into separate bowl ; that way , if you lose count , you can recheck
measure before mixing ingredients .

2 . always pour liquid ingredients over the entire surface of the dry
ingredients , meanwhile tossing lightly with fork to incorporate dry
ingredients into wet without overworking the flour .

3 . dip cutter into flour between cutting each biscuit to prevent
dough from sticking to cutter .

4 . any scraps left over after cutting dough can be sprinkled with
sugar , then baked . or , to avoid wastage , pat dough into a square ,
then cut into squares instead of rounds .

5 . because biscuits are rich in fat , you do n't need to grease the
baking sheet . you can leave the sheet ungreased or sprinkle baking
sheet lightly with all-purpose flour .

6 . to ensure even browning and baking , make each biscuit the same
size and shape .

7 . to remove sticky batter from bowl and fork , first rinse with cold
water before washing in hot soapy water .

over low heat for about 5 minutes . remove pan from heat and beat in
one at a time , the eggs . beat the batter for about 3 minutes after
each egg . add the vanilla and drop the batter from a teaspoon into
the hot fat . cook until golden , drain and dust with the
confectioner 's sugar to be good these must be delicate in flavor ,
therefore the frying fat must be impeccable . if you fry in the usual
bland cooking oil , heat it to 365-70 degrees and cook the batter
until almost golden . if you use butter or part butter for frying ,
start frying with the fat at 330 degrees and let the heat rise over a
7 minute period to 360 . be sure to bring the heat of the fat down to
330 again between cookings .

basic bread sponge

breads

1/4 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 1/2 cup water -- 105-115 degrees
4 cup all-purpose flour --
1 unbleached

whisk the yeast into the water . allow to sit for about three
minutes . add the flour , mixing for another three minutes . place in a
nonreactive bowl and cover . allow to sit in a draft-free spot until
it rises and gets thick and sticky . this will take about eight hours .

use a spoon to stir the sponge down before measuring for use in a
bread .

once risen , refrigerate for up to three days . allow to come to room
temperature before using . if it goes beyond three days , discard all
but 1 cup of the sponge and make the recipe , adding the reserved
sponge with the flour . stir for two or three minutes before using .

for all of the breads based upon this sponge , allow two days since the
doughs require overnight refrigeration .

for the best results , use as little of the kneading flour as possible .

to allow yourself to slide the loaves into the oven , form them on a
baking sheet without sides or on the bottom of one with sides that is
turned upside-down .

if you do not have a stone or tiles , bake directly on the baking
sheet ( s ) upon which you formed the loaves ( be sure to use either
cornmeal or parchment between the dough and the sheet ) .

all of the breads based upon the sponge can be frozen for up to two
weeks . do n't freeze until the bread has cooled thoroughly - then wrap
in foil and freeze . when ready to use , thaw them , still wrapped , at
room temperature overnight . then , unwrap and warm at 350 degrees for
5 or 10 minutes . alternatively , you could warm the frozen and wrapped
loaves at
300 for 35 to 40 minutes .

let stand again at room temperature , then refrigerate . continue the
process each time you use some of it .

making the loaf

breads

: directions only

making the loaf

kneading

kneading develops the gluten in the flour to form a framework for
holding the gases given off by the yeast . the kitchenaid mixer not
only effortlessly tackles kneading but provides the constant rhythm
necessary for best results . after all the flour has been added ,
continue to knead for approximately 2 minutes until the dough is
smooth and satiny , not sticky . shape the dough into a ball and place
in an oiled bowl . brush the top of the dough with additional oil to
prevent a crust from forming while rising . cover the bowl with a
towel or plastic wrap and let rise in a warm ( 70 degrees f to 85
degrees f ) place , free from drafts .

rising

let the dough rise until double in size . to test the dough , depress
two fingers into the center and if the dent stays , it has doubled .
punch the dough down by pushing your fist into the center of the
dough and pulling the edges over to the center . turn the dough over .
letting the dough rise a second time before shaping will yield a
finer textured loaf .

shaping

there are many ways to shape a loaf . specialty breads , such as braids
or rolls , will generally include directions in the recipes . two
simple methods for shaping standard loaves are as follows :

form the dough into an oval the size of the pan , stretching and
turning ends of the dough under and pinching into a seam . place in
prepared pan , seam side down . roll the dough into a rectangle
slightly longer than the size of the pan . beginning with the shorter
side , roll dough towards you . seal long seam as well as ends with
hands . fold sealed ends under and place loaf , seam side down , into
prepared pan .

baking

place loaves in the center of the oven , leaving space for the heat to
surround the pans . to check for doneness , remove one loaf from its
pan and tap the bottom . if it sounds hollow it is done . turn loaves
onto racks immediately after baking to prevent sogginess .

bread making tips

1.always store flour in an airtight container in a cool , dry place .
for long-term storage , store flour and yeast in refrigerator or
freezer . 2.to measure flour , spoon it lightly into a dry measuring
cup and level with a spatula . 3.use the grain mill to grind whole
wheat berries and other grains into flour . one cup of grain yields
approximately 1-1/4 cups of flour , except for rolled oats which
yields 7/8 cup of flour . 4.always check liquid temperature with an
accurate thermometer .

5.allow bread to rise in a warm , draft-free place . place bowl of
dough on rack over pan of warm water . or , set oven on lowest setting
for 10 minutes . turn oven off and place bowl of dough in oven . 6.for
soft crusts and extra shine , brush finished bread with melted butter
and cool uncovered . 7.for crispier crusts , brush loaves with a
mixture of one egg white and one tablespoon of cold water before
baking . 8.inverting finished bread onto racks immediately from oven
prevents a soggy loaf . 9.some large recipes and soft doughs may climb
over the collar of the dough hook . this indicates the dough needs
more flour . the sooner all the flour is added , the less likely the
dough is to climb the hook . try starting with all but the last cup of
flour in the initial mixing process . then add the remaining flour as
quickly as possible , never exceeding the total amount given in the
recipe . 10.dough made with whole grain flour may not form a ball on
the dough hook during kneading . however , as long as there is contact
between the hook and the dough , kneading will be accomplished .
11.allow bread to cool completely before slicing . 12.baked yeast
breads may be stored in the freezer for up to six months . wrap
securely in plastic wrap or aluminum foil . to thaw , let stand at room
temperature for 3 hours .

make a smooth batter with the flours , eggs , milk and water , then stir
in the cool melted butter for extra richness and to prevent sticking
during cooking . use a 6-inch pan and make thin pancakes in the usual
way , but be sure to stir the batter vigorously in between making each
pancake or all the buckwheat flour will sink to the bottom of the
mixture . if preparing ahead , cool the pancakes then stack them
( interleaved with greaseproof paper ) and wrap in a foil parcel .

to make the filling , wash and boil or steam the spinach until just
tender . chop it and squeeze out all the liquid ( save the juices for a
soup ) . chop the onion finely and sweat it in a knob of butter until
it 's deliciously soft . stir in the spinach , season with a little
salt , lots of pepper and the garlic . toast the walnuts and crumbled
stilton into the spinach mixture to give it savoury flavour and bite .
stuff the pancakes with the mixture , roll them up neatly and pile
them into a lightly buttered gratin dish . cover with foil and heat
through in the oven for 25-30 minutes at 400 f ( 200 c ) gas mark 6 .

make a smooth rich sauce with the butter , flour , stock ( preferably
good chicken stock ) and cream . let it simmer for about 5 minutes ,
stirring once or twice , then season with the cheese , mustard and salt
and pepper . if the sauce is made ahead , reheat it in a double-boiler
for serving , then pour it over the dish of pancakes just before
bringing to table .

half moon bay pumpkin bread

breads , quick bread

3 cup sugar , granulated
3 1/2 cup flour , all-purpose
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 teaspoon nutmeg
4 large eggs
1 cup vegetable oil
2 cup pumpkin ( cooked )
2/3 cup water
1 1/2 cup walnuts , chopped
1 cream cheese ( optional ; for serving )

preheat the oven to 350 degrees f. butter your containers well .

sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl . make a well in the
center of the dry ingredients , and add the eggs , oil , pumpkin and water .
beat thoroughly . it 's easier to get all the lumps out if you use an
electric mixer . stir in the walnuts with a wooden spoon .

pour the batter into the containers , filling each only half to two-thirds
full . bake for 60-90 minutes , depending on the sizes of your containers .
if you 're using a very small container , start checking much sooner . the
bread is done when a toothpick in the middle comes out clean .

cool about ten minutes , then loosen the edges of the bread with a knife ,
and turn out of the pans to cool the rest of the way on a rack . for baking
containers , you can use a loaf pan , metal cans , or whatever . i usually use
1-pound coffee cans , and it takes three of them . if you want tiny loaves ,
you could probably use soup cans .

notes :

* a dessert bread made from pumpkins -- every year in half moon bay ,
california there is a pumpkin festival , at which prizes are given for the
largest pumpkin in the world . never mind that for the last two years the
winner has been in nova scotia : the citizens of half moon bay take
pumpkins very seriously .

at christmas time in half moon bay , people give each other little tins of
this bread as presents . i also take it backpacking , because it 's pretty
resistant to being squashed ( and tastes fine even when it is ) . yield : 3
1-pound loaves .

* i think the nuts are important in this recipe . unless you absolutely
hate them , leave them in .

* it 's not necessary , but you can serve some good cream cheese with it to
spread on the slices if you like .

: difficulty : easy to moderate .
: time : 15 minutes preparation , 90 minutes cooking .

oatmeal honey bread

breads

2 cup oatmeal , uncooked ( e.g. , quaker 's o ; ld fashioned oatmeal )
2/3 cup honey
2 tablespoon salt
3 tablespoon butter ( or margarine )
1 cup water , boiling
2 pkg yeast ( dry ) , active
1 cup water , lukewarm
2/3 cup milk
5 cup flour , unbleached ( up to 6 c ; may substitute up to 2 c
1 oil

put the oatmeal , honey , salt and butter in a large mixing bowl . add
boiling water and mix together . let stand for 45 minutes , stirring
occasionally .

following the yeast package directions , add the yeast to lukewarm water ,
and let it soften for about 5 minutes . add the yeast mixture to the oats
and honey mixture . mix in the milk and stir well .

stir in the flour , 1/2 cup at a time . when the dough is too stiff to stir ,
pour it out onto a well-floured surface and knead it firmly , adding a
little flour if necessary . knead it until the dough is smooth and elastic
( about 6-8 minutes ) . form the dough into a ball . place the dough into a
large greased bowl , coating the entire ball of dough .

cover with a damp cloth and place in a warm , cozy , humid place . ( i put it
in a cool oven , with a small saucepan of hot tap water sitting on the
bottom of the oven . ) let rise for about 1 1/2 hours , or until the dough has
doubled in bulk .

punch down the dough and split in half . spread the dough into two greased
loaf pans , coating the dough as before , and cover with a damp cloth , and
let rise for about an hour in a warm , cozy , humid place .

bake at 350 f for 35-40 minutes , or until loaves sound hollow when tapped .
cool on a bread rack for about ten minutes .

notes :

* a yeast bread for people who like oatmeal . yield : makes 2 loaves .

* kneading is difficult to describe in words , but many cookbooks have
pictures . the idea is to exercise the dough and work some more flour into
it . bread freezes very well ; give it an hour or so to thaw , then heat it up
at 350 degrees f. for about ten minutes .

* instant and quick-cooking oatmeal is not satisfactory in this recipe .
besides the ubiquitous quaker oats , you can use any commercial rolled oats
or steel-cut oats . if you use the steel-cut oats , then soak for 1 hour in
step 1 .

: difficulty : easy if you already know how to knead dough , moderate
otherwise .
: time : 30 minutes preparation , 4 1/2 hours waiting time .
: precision : all amounts ( including times ) are approximate .

vienna christmas stollen

breads

1 1/2 cup milk ; scald/cool to lukewarm
3 1/2 yeast ; dry/envelopes
3/4 cup water ; lukewarm
3 cup flour ; sifted
1/2 cup eggs ; yolks/lightly beaten
3/4 cup sugar
2 teaspoon salt
1 cup flour
1/2 cup butter ; softened
1 flour ; 10-11 c. as needed
5 cup sultanas ; ( currants )
1 1/2 cup almonds ; chopped or slivered
1 cup citron ; chopped
1/2 lemon ; rind only/grated
2 teaspoon rum

milk should be cooled to about 100 degrees . dissolve the yeast in the
lukewarm water and add 1/4 c. of the cooled milk and 3 c. sifted
flour . cover the sponge with a cloth and let it ripen until bubbles
appear on the surface and it is about to drop in the center . pour the
remaining milk over the sponge . add the egg yolks , sugar and salt and
beat until the ingredients are well blended . add 1 cup flour and beat
well . blend in the butter . add more flour gradually to make a smooth
dough , or until 10 to 11 cups have been added . some flours absorb
more liquid than others . knead in the sultanas , almonds , and citron ,
along with the lemon rind which should be mixed with the rum . knead
the dough until the fruits and nuts are dispersed well through it and
it is smooth . dust the top lightly with flour and let it rise in a
warm place about 45 minutes . punch it down and let stand for 20
minutes . divide the dough in half and knead the pieces until smooth .
let them stand for 10 minutes longer . place one ball of dough on a
lightly floured board , and with a rolling pin , press down the center
of the ball , and roll the pin to and fro 4 to 5 times , pressing all
the time to make an elliptical shape 6 inches long and 3 1/2 '' wide .
the center rolled part should be 1/8 '' thick and 4 inches long . both
ends should remain untouched , resembling rather thick lips . place
this rolled out piece of dough on a buttered baking sheet and brush
the center part with melted butter . fold one lip toward the other and
on the top of it . press the fingertips down near and below the lips ,
pulling somewhat apart . give a pull away from each end , pointing them
toward the lips . the shape should resemble a waning moon . repeat the
process with the second piece of dough . ( unless you have gone
completely crazy by now ! note : my comment , not gourmet 's ) . let the
stollen rise , covered in a warm place until they double in bulk ,
about 1 1/2 hours . bake them in a moderately hot oven ( 375 degrees )
for 35 to 40 minutes . do not overbake them . cool them on racks . brush
them with butter and cover with vanilla sugar . recipe will be posted

corn biscuits

desserts , quick bread

1/2 cup butter , softened -- at room
1 temperature
1/2 cup sugar
1 cup yellow cornmeal
2 eggs at room temperature
1 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour ( approx )

preheat oven to 375 degrees fahrenheit . stir the butter into a soft
mass ; slowly add sugar , blending together well . add cornmeal , eggs ,
and salt . beat until the mixture is smooth ; add 1-1/4 c. flour ( the
mixture will be soft and moist ) . roll the dough out to 1/4 ''
thickness ; if the dough is too sticky to roll , add 1/4 c. flour and
blend into the top of the dough with your hands ( i find it 's also
easier if you roll out on a lightly floured board ) . cut out 4 dozen
1-1/2 '' rounds with a cookie cutter ( i 've also used squares , etc . --
whatever cutters i had handy at the time ) . place close together on a
lightly greased baking sheet , but do n't let them touch . bake on
center shelf for about 22 minutes or until biscuits are just starting
to turn slightly brown around the edges . near the end of this baking
period turn the baking sheet around for even cooking . if the biscuits
near the outer edges of the sheet are browning too fast then just
remove them if they 're done or rearrange the biscuits on the sheet so
the brown-er ones get moved to the center . remove biscuits from the
oven and cool on a rack . these are wonderful served warm ; they freeze
very well and can be warmed up when ready to serve .

if not freezing them , keep at room temperature in an airtight
container . kept this way the biscuits will last up to 10-14 days .

these biscuits are terrific served with coffee or tea , or with a dish
of fresh fruit . they are slightly sweet with a wonderful , grainy
texture due to the cornmeal in the recipe . they 're quite addictive .

( makes 4 dozen , but they do n't last long ! )

fougasse aux grattons ( flat bread with crackl

breads , meats

1 each pkg active dry yeast
1 lb flour*
250 ml tepid water
1 each egg yolk , beaten
1 lb belly of pork , diced
2 lb pork fat , diced
12 tablespoon dry white wine

*flour should be a mixture of unbleached white bread flour with 2
generous handfuls of buckwheat flour , sifted together . if you ca n't
find the buckwheat flour , do n't worry about it .

for the dough : stir together the yeast and a handful of flour in
enough water to make a runny batter . leave for 1 hour . warm the
remaining flour in the oven , mix in salt and make a well in the
middle . pour in the yeast mixture and add enough tepid water to make
a moist dough . knead for 10-12 minutes on a lightly floured surface .
leave to rise in a large floured bowl covered with a dampened cloth .
when the dough has doubled in size , turn out onto a floured work
surface , punch down and flatten the dough out . add the grattons ( see
immediately below for how to make them ) . preheat the oven to
450f/250c .

for the grattons : cook the meat , fat and wine over a *very* gentle
heat in a heavy covered saucepan . press down on the meat several
times during cooking to render up as much fat as possible . after 1
1/2 - 2 hours , pour the liquid off through a strainer . ( it can be
used instead of olive oil for cooking , and often was , in provencal
cooking . ) crisp the diced meat over higher heat , straining off any
liquid fat when necessary .

to make the fougasse , make the bread dough , and after the first
rising mix in the grattons . then , with a knife , cut through the dough
first one way , then another . reform into a ball and repeat . gather
the pieces together into a mass , divine in two and form into two flat
loaves , slashed straight through their thickness in numerous places .
spread the holes wider with your fingers . ( you are striving for an
effect like a flat sheet of bread with holes like those of a slice of
swiss cheese . ) brush the top with the egg yolk and bake on a hot
metal sheet for 30-35 minutes until crisp and golden . serve warm with
a bitter salad like endive or dandelion .

nb : this is a very rich bread -- more like a salty shortbread than
anything else . but *very* good .

tyropita trifti thrakis ( thracian style chees

appetizers , breads , greek

1 karen mintzias
1/2 cup butter
1/2 cup light olive oil
1/3 cup milk plus ; -- - >
2 tablespoon milk
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt less , if cheese is salty
1 cup grated greek cheeses
2 cup all-purpose flour ( or more )

delicious ! and simple to make in a large batch for appetizers . as
made in thrace , the soft-dough may be spread into a sheet and cut in
squares before baking , or each shaped individually into daintly
`` bastounakia '' ( little canes or sticks ) . the word `` trifti ''
identifies the texture - crisp and crumbly in the mouth . ( they are
also called `` kourou '' [ cut small ] . ) if making the individual `` little
canes , '' they should be half a ( dainty ) finger wide and a finger in
length . the secret of the crispness is in adding only enough flour to
make a soft dough .

to make about 100 1-inch squares :

the mixing of the dough may be begun with an electric mixer , but
should be finished by hand . beat the butter until fluffy , then lower
the speed and add the olive oil . continue beating , and when fluffy
beat in the milk , baking powder , salt , if necessary , and cheese .
begin adding flour , but after 1 cup stop beating with the mixer and
beat in the remaining flour by hand , adding only enough to make dough
soft enough to roll into strips . knead a few minutes . spread or roll
on buttered sheet ( jelly roll tray , cookie sheet , or any flat pan ) to
a thickness of half-finger 's width and cut into squares of desired
size ( the smaller the better , since they are rich ) . bake in a
moderate oven ( 350 degrees ) for 20 to 25 minutes , moving to the top
shelf for the last minutes to achieve a golden chestnut color . ( if
making the `` little canes , '' the baking time will be 10 to 12 minutes . )
remove when done and cook on a rack .

note : stored in covered tins , these will keep for several weeks .

basic white bread by james beard~ chef & cook

breads

1 pkg yeast ; active , dry
1/4 cup water ; warm ( 110-115 degs )
2 teaspoon sugar
1 cup milk
3 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon butter
3 3/4 cup flour ; all-purpose
-- -- egg wash -- --
1 medium egg white ; beaten slightly in 1 tbs

james beard 's basic white bread makes 1 large loaf or 2 small loaves *
making basic white bread dough * in a small bowl mix the yeast and
the 1/4 cup warm water ; add the sugar , stir well , and set aside until
proofed . it is proofed when fermentation is apparent : the mixture
will swell and small bubbles appear on the surface . ( if it does n't
proof at all , it means the yeast is not fresh . ) in a small saucepan
heat the milk with the salt and stir in the butter until it melts .
set aside to cool until it is no warmer than the yeast mixture . put 2
cups of the flour in a large mixing bowl and stir in the milk
mixture . beat well with a wooden spatula , add the yeast mixture , and
continue beating the dough until it is smooth , adding an additional
cup of flour to make a firm dough . turn the dough out onto a floured
work surface and begin the kneading process , which evenly distributes
the fermenting yeast cells through the dough . * kneading instructions
* there are several kneading methods , but the basic one is to flour
the dough and your hand lightly , then push the heel of your hand down
into the dough and away from you . fold the dough over , give it a
quarter turn , and push down again . repeat pushing , folding and
turning until the motion becomes rhythmic . knead for about 10
minutes , kneading in additional flour as necessary , until the dough
is smooth and no longer sticky , and blisters form on the surface . to
test whether the dough has been kneaded enough make an indention in
it with your fingers ; it should spring back . if blisters form on the
surface of the dough and break , this is another sign that the
kneading is sufficient . * note : if you have a heavy-duty electric
mixer with a dough-hook attachment , knead the dough with the hook and
finish it off on the board . butter a large bowl , transfer the dough
to it , and turn the bowl until the dough is well coated with butter
on all sides . cover the dough with a dish towel and let it rise in a
warm , draft-free place for 1 to 1-1/2 hours , until it is doubled in
bulk . a good , warm , draft-free place is inside your room temperature
oven . to test further if the dough has risen properly , make an
indentation in it with two fingers : if the dough does not spring
back , then it is ready . * baking preparations * butter a 9x5x3 inch
loaf pan , or two pans that are about 8x4x2 inches . punch the dough
down with your fist to deflate it ; transfer it to a floured board and
knead it well for about 3 minutes . pat it into a smooth round or oval
shape and let it rest for 4 to 5 minutes . then form into 1 large or
two small loaves , by shaping the dough into an oval the length of
your bread pan , then gently stretching , rounding , and plumping it in
the palms of your hands , tucking the edges underneath and pinching
them together . lift carefully ; drop the dough into the pan or pans
and smooth out . cover the dough with a towel and let it rise again in
a warm draft-free place for about 45 minutes to 1 hour , until it is
double in bulk . preheat the oven to 400df . brush the egg wash over
the top of the dough . bake in the center of the oven for 20 minutes ;
reduce the heat to 350df and bake for 20 to 25 minutes longer , until
the crust is well browned and the bread sounds hollow when removed
from the pan and tapped on the bottom with the knuckles . if you like
a crusty loaf , remove it from the pan about 5 to 10 minutes before
the end of the baking time and let it finish baking on the oven rack .
it will get brown and crusty all over . remove the bread from the oven
and let it cool on a rack before slicing . the bread may be stored in
a plastic bag in the refrigerator after it has cooled . if you seal it
in a bag before it is completely cooled , the crust will become soft .
stored bread will keep about 1 week . it also freezes well if wrapped
tightly in plastic wrap and sealed in a plastic bag and can be kept
for up to
3 months .

2 cup hot ( 120f to 130f ) water
1 cup lukewarm ( 100f ) water
1 sourdough starter

yield : approximately 4 cups difficulty : ( one chocolate kiss , or easy )
prepartion : 10 minutes allow at least 4 days for the starter to
ferment before using . `` day 1 : 1 . in a medium bowl , stir together 2
cups of the flour and yeast . make a well in the middle of the
flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water . continue stirring
until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth . it is not
necessary to smooth out all the lumps ; they will dissolve as the
mixture start to ferment . cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
the mixture sit at room temperature . over the next 24 hours the
mixture will rise , become very bubbly and then start to recede .

`` days 2 and 3 : 2 . stir the mixture twice , once in the morning and
once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol .
towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
bubbles . by the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
liquid may form on the surface of the starter . it is simply the
alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
carbohydrates in the flour and multiply . refresh the starter by
stirring in the cup of lukewarm water ( 100f ) and the remaining cup of
flour . stir until blended , but do not worry about any small lumps .

`` day 4 : 3 . the starter is now ready to use , or it may be poured into a
sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole , or a
flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated .

tips for making the perfect buttermilk biscui

breads , breakfast

1 good recipe for biscuits
1 light touch with dough

the perfect buttermilk biscuit thanks to eula mae dore , a great
southern cook from avery plantation , la. , i 've learned to make the
best buttermilk biscuits i 've ever had . eula mae says a good biscuit
is one of the best things to have on hand for quick meals . she uses
them in emergencies to make simple sandwiches filled with scraps of
ham or cheese and serves them with pickles and a small salad . for
dessert , she warms a biscuit or two and makes a shortcake with fresh
fruits or berries . she has convinced me that you ca n't have too many
biscuits on hand . eula mae learned to cook and bake from her
grandmother , not from cookbooks , and the artfulness of her
preparation was a joy to watch . here are some of her biscuit-making
tips : + first go out and replace your baking powder , unless you
bought it within the last four months . more baking flops occur from
old , tired baking powder than from any other cause . and do n't rely on
the old test of checking the freshness of baking powder by putting a
spoonful in a glass of water to see if it fizzes . baking powder , like
a carbonated drink , can fizz a little and still be almost flat .
buying new baking powder costs very little when you consider the cost
of baking failures . + next , eula mae insists that sifting the dry
ingredients four times is the reason her biscuits are perfect . i
tested the recipe sifting and not sifting and , indeed , sifting does
make a slightly higher , more tender biscuit . + after you cut the
biscuit dough , put the pieces on a baking sheet upside down . this
ensures a taller , lighter biscuit by making sure any edges crimped by
the pressure of the cutting do n't interfere with the rise . ( the
french use the same trick when making puff pastry . ) + the tip that
helped me the most was using less flour than usual . eula mae 's dough
was soft and sticky . she handled it gently , dusting her hands and the
dough with only enough flour to make the dough manageable . the result
was a lighter biscuit .

warm platter . cover with aluminum foil and let it stand 25 minutes
before carving .

pan . bake it in the oven for 10 minutes at 450f . then reduce the heat
to 350f and cook it an additional 15 minutes , until it is well risen

beignets with chocolate & apricot sauce

breads

3/4 cup ; water
6 tablespoon butter , unsalted ; cut into slices
1 tablespoon sugar
1/8 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup flour , sifted
3 large egg ; room temperature
1 oil , for shallow frying
1 sugar , powdered ; ( garnish )
-- -- bittersweet chocolate sauce -- --
4 oz chocolate , semi-sweet
1 oz chocolate , unsweetened
1/2 cup ; water
2 1/2 tablespoon butter , unsalted
1/2 cup sugar , powdered
-- -- apricot sauce -- --
1 cup apricot preserves
3 tablespoon apricot brandy ; or water

pour the water into a small , heavy saucepan , and add the butter ,
granu- lated sugar , and salt . bring to a rolling boil , at which time
the butter should be melted . add the flour all at once . lower the
heat , and cook , stirring constantly with a wooden spoon , for a minute
or two , until the mixture comes away from the sides of the pan .

remove the pan from the heat , and beat in the eggs , one at a time ,
incorporating each egg thoroughly before adding the next . continue
beating until thick and smooth . allow the mixture to cool while
heating the oil .

pour enough vegtable oil in a large skillet so that it is at least 1
inch deep . heat to 360 degrees .

drop the mixture by heaping teaspoonfuls into the hot oil , frying
only a few beignets at one time so that they are not crowded . fry for
about 4 to 5 minutes , or until they are crusty and a dark golden
brown , turning occasionally with a spoon so that they color evenly .

note : it is important that the fritters are crusty , if undercooked ,
they will deflate before being served .
using a 10-inch skillet , you should be able to fry 10 fritters at a
time ( one-third the mixture ) .

when they are sufficiently cooked , remove the fritters with a slotted
spoon , and drain on paper toweling . place successive batches in a 250
degree oven to keep hot while frying the remainder .

place the beignets on a heated serving platter , and dust the tops
generously with confectioner 's sugar put through a wire sieve . pass
the sauces separately .

chocolate sauce : chop the chocolates into coarse pieces and place in
the top of a double boiler set over barely simmering water . add the
water , butter and sugar . stir occasionally until the chocolate is
melted and the mixture is well blended and smooth . remove from the
heat , but keep the sauce over hot water until ready to serve . it
should be served warm .

apricot sauce : turn the apricot preserves into a small saucepan . add
3 tablespoons of the brandy or water , and simmer , stirring , just until
thoroughly heated . add additional liquid , if necessary , to bring to a
sauce consistency . serve warm . note : if there are any large pieces
of fruit in the preserves , break them up while heating . submitted by

2 1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon yeast ( active ) , dry ( one package )
1 tablespoon sugar
1 tablespoon salt ( optional )
1/4 cup oil
2 eggs , beaten
10 cup flour ( or less )
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon water

dissolve the yeast and sugar in lukewarm water ( 105 degrees f. ) . ( lukewarm
water feels neither hot nor cold when a drop is placed on your wrist . ) let
sit for 10 minutes to proof the yeast . if there are no bubbles in the
water after this time , the yeast is inactive and you should start over with
new yeast .

add the salt ( optional ) , oil , eggs and most of the flour to the 2 1/4 cups
of water . mix . place dough on floured board and knead for 5-10 minutes .

place dough in a clean bowl , brush some oil on the top ( optional ) and cover
the bowl with a towel . let rise in a warm place until doubled , about 1 1/2
hours .

punch the dough down and let rise until doubled again ( maybe another hour ) .

punch dough down and place onto floured board . form into two loaves . you
can make normal loaves , or you can cut the dough and braid ( with three or
six pieces per loaf ) , or you can make braided or un-braided rolls , or you
can roll the dough out until it 's about 1/4 inch thick and then spread
fried onions over it . place loaves into oiled pans .

cover pans and let rise for about 30 minutes . ( skip this step if you 've
rolled the dough out and covered with onions . )

mix the egg yolk with about 1 tablespoon of water . brush loaves with this
mixture . ( again , skip this if you 've rolled the dough out . ) bake at 400
degrees f. for 20 minutes , then lower heat to 350 degrees f. and bake for
40 additional minutes . if you are making rolls , you probably need to bake
for a total of 20-25 minutes .

you can add poppy or sesame seeds to the dough , or you can sprinkle the
seeds on top . this bread is traditionally made with white flour , but is
still good if made with all or part whole wheat flour . i think its good
taste comes from the oil and eggs in the dough .

notes :

* challah is a traditional jewish bread that is part of many festivals ,
including sabbath dinners and weddings . for making a wedding loaf , this
recipe can be doubled and used to make one braided loaf . it will fill up
the entire oven , and you will have to find a cookie sheet big enough to put
the loaf on . yield : 2 loaves .

: difficulty : easy , as bread goes .
: time : preparation : 3-5 hours ( including rising ) ; baking : 1 hour .
: precision : measure ingredients carefully .

bread making ( lesson four of four )

breads

1 ( in which we get a little
1 fancy )

first , let 's review the basic recipe for one loaf of `` plain '' white
bread --

3 c all-purpose flour 1 pkg yeast 1 1/4 c liquid ( water or
milk ... milk recommended ) 1 egg ( optional but recommended ) an egg can
be added for extra flavor and nutrition ; it softens the crust and
gives the interior a finer crumb . 1 teaspoon salt ( optional but
recommended ) 1 tablespoon sugar ( optional but recommended )

mix about three minutes until dough does not stick to floured fingers .
knead for no less than 10 minutes ; cover with towel and let it rise
in a warm ( 75 - 80 f ) place for about an hour , or until it has about
doubled in size ; punch it down ; let it rest about 15 minutes ; place
in greased bread pan ; cover ; let it rise about another hour ; bake at
400 degrees for 25 to 30 minutes or until it sounds `` hollow '' when
thumped ; remove from pan ; let cool .

to make 2 loaves , simply double everything except the yeast .

now , for a couple of variations on a theme :

rye bread -- instead of 3 cups of all-purpose flour , use 2 cups of
all- purpose and 1 cup of rye flour ( available at a health food
store ) ... add 2 tablespoons of caraway seed to the dough ... use
buttermilk instead of plain milk or water ... add 1/3 cup of light
molasses to the dough ... omit the sugar ... the egg is still
optional ... instead of baking in a bread pan , shape into a round ball
and bake on a lightly greased cookie sheet . reduce the baking
temperature to 350 degrees ... baking time may be 5 - 10 minutes
longer ... ( one loaf ) .

whole wheat bread -- increase sugar to 1 1/2 tablespoons ... use 1 1/2
cups of all-purpose flour and 2 cups of whole-wheat flour ... use milk
instead of water ... add 1/4 cup of butter or margarine ... add 1/2 cup
molasses ... the egg is still optional . the method is the same except
the baking time may be 5 - 10 minutes longer .

for the above two variations , do not be tempted to use all rye flour
or all whole-wheat flour . those flours do not have enough gluten in
them for proper rising action , so you must use some all-purpose
flour , otherwise your finished product will be very heavy and close
textured .

for high-altitude baking ( above 5,000 feet ) , use 1/2 the yeast . yeast
dough rises faster at high altitudes .

a `` perfect '' loaf of bread should :

o have a well-browned , evenly rounded top o have a soft and moist
interior , easily pulled apart o have a uniform color o have an even
texture -- holes are small and uniform in size from top to bottom

to keep bread fresh , wrap each cooled loaf in foil or plastic wrap ,
or seal in a plastic bag ; store in a cool , dry cupboard or bread box .
bread may be stored in the refrigerator but it goes stale more
quickly .

bread keeps in the freezer for up to 3 months if tightly wrapped in
foil , heavy-duty plastic wrap , or freezer wrap , or sealed in plastic
bags . always make sure to press out as much air as possible .

well , that 's about it , li'l buckaroos . do n't be afraid to experiment
~ add raisins , nuts , cheese , finely diced and lightly sauteed onions ,
or anything else you can think of to the dough . add green food
coloring for st. patrick 's day ! add a squid or two ... play around
with using different liquids ... a friend of mine recently told me she
was baking a cake and ran out of milk , so she substituted baby
formula ... said it was the best cake she 'd ever made ! play around with
different shapes ... knots , pinwheels , crescents , rolls , etc . use your
imagination ! make a heart-shaped loaf of bread for valentine 's day or
a birthday ! tell us about your successes , give your not-so-valiant .

addition , until the dough becomes smooth . it will be wet and slightly
sticky . cover your hands with a little flour , turn the dough out onto
a lightly floured surface , and knead briefly .

form the dough into a ball and place in a lightly greased loaf pan .
it can also be divided into small balls to make dinner rolls ( place
on a lightly greased cookie sheet or in a muffin tin ) . cover with
plastic wrap and let rise until the dough has more than doubled ,
about 1 to 1-1/2 hours . while the dough is rising , preheat oven to
275 degrees f .

brown and the sides are slightly brown , an hour or 70 minutes . check

simple orange muffins

breads , vegetarian

1 large orange
1 oz tofu
3/4 cup sugar ; ( less if desired )
3 tablespoon oil
1/2 cup water or orange juice
2 cup flour
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon cream of tartar
1/4 teaspoon salt

preheat the oven to 350 degrees f .

finely grate the zest from the orange . squeeze out and strain the
orange 's juice . set zest and juice aside .

in a bowl , thoroughly mash the tofu with the sugar , or blend together
with an electric mixer . mix in the finely grated orange zest and
juice from the orange , oil , and water ( or additional orange juice ) .

in a large bowl , sift together the flour , baking soda , cream of
tartar and salt . blend in the orange juice mixture . spoon batter
into muffin pans , filling each cup about 2/3 full . bake for about 15
minutes , or until muffins are starting to brown very lightly , and
toothpick inserted in center comes out clean .

karen 's notes : i always use tofu as an egg-replacer in baked goods ,
with excellent results . it may only be luck , or coincidence , so if
you do n't have a piece of tofu handy , try omitting it .

these muffins are pretty sweet , so you may want to decrease the
amount of sugar used . the sugar does seem to act as a humectant
though , so the muffins will stay a little moister in storage if you
use more sugar .

corn tortillas ( making )

breads , world

-- -- for 16 tortillas -- --
1 1/2 cup masa harina
1/2 cup cornmeal
1 1/2 tablespoon oil
1 1/3 cup warm water

mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl and beat with a
wooden spoon until thick and smooth . scrape the sides of the bowl ,
and cover the surface of the dough with plastic wrap while pressing
and frying individual tortillas so the dough will not dry out . to
form the tortillas , wet your hands and pull off a lump of dough about
the size of a golfball . roll it into a ball . tear off 2 pieces of
plastic wrap about a foot long . either in a tortilla press , or
between 2 dinner plates , place the ball between the sheets of plastic
wrap . press down with the palm of your hand to flatten slightly , then
press firmly to form a thin circle . use the first tortilla to test
the consistency of the dough . if the edges of the tortilla are uneven
and crumbly , the dough needs a little more water . if the sheet of
plastic sticks to the dough and it is very soft , add a few
tablespoons of masa harina . repeat with the remaining dough , leaving
individual tortillas between the sheets of plastic wrap . heat a heavy
skillet over medium-high heat until hot . peel off the top sheet of
plastic and invert the tortilla into the hot pan . grill until
stiffened , about 30 seconds ; turn for 1 minute or less , until the
side is slightly browned , then turn to the first side for 30 seconds .
the time for grilling each tortilla is less than 2 minutes . repeat

white-flour sourdough starter

breads

2 cup tepid ( 80 ) water
1 pkg yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
2 cup flour

mix the water , sugar and yeast until dissolved . beat in the flour
until the batter is smooth . pour into a clean 2 qt . jar and cover
with a cloth . let stand at room temp . for 2 to 3 days or until
starter has a sharp , almost winy odor and is bubbly ( it will be full
of lively bubbles after a short time and will continue to bubble ,
more sedately , until it is sufficiently sour ) . exact times ca n't be
given , as weather and temp affect the rate of fermentation .
to use : if not used at once , cover the starter with a lid and
refrigerate it . it will be lively enough to use for about 18 hrs ; if
refrigerated longer , `` feed '' it lightly and let it become bubbly at
room temp - usually letting it stand overnight - before using it .
this tangy batter is the key ingredient of english muffins and many
other sourdough breads . this recipe makes 3 cups enough to make a
large batch of muffins , with enough left over to serve as a nucleus
for a future baking . the starter keeps well in a covered jar in the
refrigerator so long as it is `` fed '' with a small amount of flour and
an equal amount of water about every 2 weeks - this keeps the yeasts
alive . or freeze it for indefinite storage . to revive it , feed it
after it thaws and let it stand at room temperature until bubbly
enough to use . if liquid gathers on the surface of stored starter ,
stir it in before adding flour and water . your starter will be good
so long as it responds to feeding and has a pleasantly odor . if
neglected , it may develop a pink or greenish tinge and an unpleasant
odor . if that should happen , start over . to increase a small amount
of leftover starter to a quantity large enough for a baking , add
flour and water in equal quantities , but never exceed the proportion
of a cup of flour to a cup of starter . let the mix ferment , lightly
covered , at room temp until very bubbly ; then , if you need still more
starter , add more flour and water and ferment again .

waffles - history

breads , breakfast

1 text

waffles are as american as apple pie , and like apple pie are an
import . the word `` waffle '' and probably the food , comes to us from the
dutch `` wafel '' , but the french eat them too , calling them `` gaufre ''
from the old french `` wafla '' . whatever their provenance , waffles have
been eaten by americans since pilgrim times .

europeans eat their waffles as a sweet course , topping them with
powdered sugar , whipped cream , or honey or stuffing them with icing .
americans have occasionally served waffles for dessert - perhaps a
chocolate waffle with ice cream - but in general we eat them for
breakfast with all-american maple syrup . at least now we do , if we
eat waffles at all .

but in the thirties , and before that , americans ate waffles with
virtually anything that could be spooned or poured over their bumpy ,
golden tops . and we ate them for breakfast , for luncheon , and for
supper . if we served them to guests at a sunday night supper , it
became a waffle supper , `` sure to be a party guests remember , ''
according to the general foods cookbook `` all about home baking ''
( 1933 ) .

and we made waffles with just about everything : cheese waffles ;
cornmeal waffles ; coconut , pineapple , and chocolate waffles ;
gingerbread waffles ; banana waffles ; cheese and tomato , date , and
peanut butter waffles ; apple waffles ; oatmeal waffles ; and prune ,
bran , apricot , and even pea pulp waffles ( which pictorial review
featured as one of their best recipes for 1927 . )

basic pizza dough

breads , italian

4 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose
1 white flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup olive oil
2 pkg dry yeast
1 1/2 cup warm water
2 teaspoon light brown sugar

measure 1/2 cup warm water ( 110 f ) into 2 cup container and stir in
the brown sugar . ( make sure water is warm , not hot - too hot will
kill the yeast ) . dissolve the 2 packages of dried yeast in the water
and set it aside for 5 minutes . will become frothy . ( about 2 cups
worth ! )

sift 4 cups of the flour and the salt into a large mixing bowl . make
a depression in the middle of the flour and pour in 3/4 of the olive
oil and 1 cup of warm water . when the yeast is ready , add it also .

dust your kneading surface with flour , then mix the ingredients in
the bowl with your hands . place dough ball on the floured surface
and knead from 8 to 10 minutes . add flour to the kneading surface if
the dough is too sticky or wet . eventually the dough will become
elastic .

rub the insides of a clean bowl with the remaining olive oil and
place the dough in it , coating the dough with olive oil by turning it
in the bowl . cover with a clean cloth and let rise in warm ,
draft-free place until double in size , 1 1/2 hours to 2 hours . an
oven with the light on or a lit burner pilot will provide suitable
heat for rising dough .

when dough has risen , divide into two halves , then roll each out on
floured surface . a round shape may be cut out with table knife using
12 '' bowl or plate as template .

sufficient for 2 12 '' thin-crust pizzas , or 1 12 '' thick-crust .

hint : before filling and baking , form rim around outer ring of pizza
dough to hold ingredients better . brush the inside area of the
dough , not the rim , with olive oil and let the dough sit in a warm
place and rise a little before filling . then spoon in sauce , cover
with 1 lb . mozzarella cheese , add meat toppings , then cover with
mozzarella/parmesan mixture of cheese . then brush rim of pizza crust
with olive oil . sprinkle the pizza pan or oven tiles with cornmeal to
prevent pizza from sticking to cooking surface !

the very best : cook on a pizza stone or oven tile at 500 f. the
unglazed oven tile makes a huge difference in the crispiness and
texture of the crust . it absorbs moisture and keeps oven temperatures
even . may even be removed with pizza and set on a rack on table -
will keep pizza warm much longer .

sourdough~ pt . 2

breads

3 cup unbleached all-purpose
1 flour , divided
1 teaspoon active dry yeast
2 cup hot ( 120f to 130f ) water
1 cup lukewarm ( 100f ) water
1 sourdough starter

yield : approximately 4 cups difficulty : ( one chocolate kiss , or easy )
prepartion : 10 minutes allow at least 4 days for the starter to
ferment before using . `` day 1 : 1 . in a medium bowl , stir together 2
cups of the flour and yeast . make a well in the middle of the
flour/yeast mixture and whisk in the hot water . continue stirring
until the mixture is blended but not completely smooth . it is not
necessary to smooth out all the lumps ; they will dissolve as the
mixture start to ferment . cover the bowl with a clean towel and let
the mixture sit at room temperature . over the next 24 hours the
mixture will rise , become very bubbly and then start to recede .

`` days 2 and 3 : 2 . stir the mixture twice , once in the morning and
once in the evening to invigorate the yeast and to expel the alcohol .
towards the end of the second day the mixture will start to thin and
the surface of the starter will be covered with lots of tiny air
bubbles . by the evening of the third day a thin layer of yellow-brown
liquid may form on the surface of the starter . it is simply the
alcohol given off by the yeast cells as they feed on the
carbohydrates in the flour and multiply . refresh the starter by
stirring in the cup of lukewarm water ( 100f ) and the remaining cup of
flour . stir until blended , but do not worry about any small lumps .

`` day 4 : 3 . the starter is now ready to use , or it may be poured into a
sterilzed 2 quart glass or ceramic covered crock or casserole , or a
flass jar with a non-metal lid and refrigerated .

the cutouts and create a lacy effect . remember that this is all done
before the cookies are baked .

daddy 's sourdough apricot walnut bread

breads , sourdough

1 cup starter
1 1/2 cup water
1/2 cup oil
1/2 cup sugar
12 apricots ( dried ) , diced
1/4 cup walnuts , coarsely chopped
2 cup whole wheat flour
4 cup bread flour , bromated
1 teaspoon salt

feed starter 1/2 c sugar , 1 c water and 1 t instant potato flakes
once a week , stirring well . let mixture sit in uncovered container
all day to feed and grow . after 8 - 10 hours , remove 1 cup of starter
to bake bread ; return remainder of starter to refrigerator in loosely
covered container .

combine starter , water , oil , sugar and apricots and mix well . add
walnuts and the whole wheat flour ; blend together with a whisk . add 2
cups of the bread flour and mix again .

add the last 2 cups of the bread flour , combined with the salt , and
mix again .

the dough will be sticky and a little stiff . put the dough in a
greased ( or sprayed with pam ) bowl and cover with a damp cloth . let
rise until doubled in bulk .

punch down and divide into three equal pieces . put each piece into a
greased loaf pan and let rise until they reach the tops of the pans .
bake at 350 degrees f. for 30 minutes or until browned and pulling
away from the sides of the pans .

cathe 's notes :

* was originally dot howell 's recipe . you can substitute white corn
syrup for part or all of the oil ; the bread might cook more quickly
and brown too soon if not watched carefully . can also substitute
1/4 c oatmeal for 1/4 c flour .

* daddy speeds up the process ; he feeds the starter and then puts it
into a hot water bath for about an hour . while the starter sits in
its bath , he mixes his ingredients for the bread . he uses 1 cup of
the starter and lets the remainder sit outside for several hours . he
makes his dough and puts it in a hot water bath to rise . when he
punches it down , he puts the pans over a hot water bath to rise . he
accomplishes the entire process in one day instead of two days .

irish soda bread # 1

breads

3 1/2 cup flour
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1 1/4 cup buttermilk : to 2 1/2 c *

* you will need somewhere between these two amounts of buttermilk ,
depending on how much liquid your flour tends to absorb . try to avoid
using regular milk : if you must , use baking powder instead of
bicarbonate of soda . -- lightly grease a heavy skillet ( if making
`` soda farl '' , the flat version of soda bread ) or preheat the oven to
450 f ( if making `` soda cake '' , the round , more breadlike version . )
sift the dry ingredients together into a large bowl ; make sure the
soda is evenly distributed . make a well in the center of the dry
mixture and add about half the buttermilk . stir until you have a
raggy dough that is very squashy but which looks more or less dry .
add more liquid sparingly until you achieve this texture . blend until
all the flour has achieved this consistency ; then turn out
immediately onto a lightly floured board and knead ***for no more
than a minute or a minute and a half*** . overkneading makes this
bread very tough , and it 's very easy to overdo it . if making soda
cake , shape the dough into a circle about 8-9 inches across and about
an inch and a half thick . cut a cross about on the top , about half an
inch deep , and place on a floured baking sheet . bake at 450 f for
45-50 minutes . if making soda farl , shape the dough into a circle
about 9 inches by one inch thick and cut into four wedges or `` farls '' :
place in the preheated skillet , with cut edges about half an inch
apart . cook slowly on the stovetop over low-to-medium heat : it should
take about 20 minutes for the farls to puff up and turn a light brown
on the pan side . turn them and cook for another 20 minutes . -- for a
softer crust on either soda cake or soda farl , wrap in a dishtowel
after baking . -- for more information on making sodabread and its

3/4 cup ( 3 ounces ) shredded sharp cheddar c ; heese
1 1/2 teaspoon cracked black pepper

i forget what kinds of recipes you like . here are a couple of easy
looking cornbread recipes from a new book a friend gave me .

from : working mother 29-minute meals

preheat oven to 425 deg.f . grease 8-inch square baking pan . prepare
corn bread mix according to package directions , adding cheese to
batter . pour batter into prepared pan ; sprinkle evenly with black
pepper . bake for 15 minutes , or until golden brown and toothpick
inserted into center comes out clean . cut corn bread into squares .

makes about 12 squares .

herbed corn bread

bake this savory cornbread in the morning and serve at room
temperature -- or if desired , reheat it briefly before serving .

2 boxes ( 8 1/2-ounce size ) cornbread or corn muffin mix 1/2 cup
cottage cheese 1/4 cup minced parsley 1/4 cup snipped fresh chives or
scallions

1 . preheat oven to 350 deg.f . grease several corn-stick molds or
two 8 inch square baking pans . set aside .

2 . prepare mixes according to package directions , adding cottage
cheese , parsley and chives to batter . spoon into prepared molds . bake
for 12 to 15 minutes , or until lightly browned ( corn bread baked in
square pans will take about 25 minutes ) .

my note : even if you dislike cottage cheese , when cottage cheese is
baked into breads and the like it looses its cottage-cheese-ness ; - )
and just tends to make the breads moist . also , you could probably add
smidgens of other herbs to this last bread ... tiny bits of basil or
oregano or thyme , to give it just a hint of herby flavor .

cato 's grape bread

breads

4 cup unbleached , all-purpose
1 flour
1/2 cup lard , shortening , or butter
1 melted and cooled
1/4 cup feta cheese , crumbled and
1 mashed into a paste
1 teaspoon cumin seed , ground
1 teaspoon anise , ground
1 1/2 cup grape juice , purple or white
1 pkg dry yeast
8 bay leaves

1 ) place the flour , lard , mashed cheese , ground cumin and anise ,
and yeast in a large mixing bowl . blend well . add the grape juice and
mix the dough well for 2-3 minutes until all the grape juice is
absorbed and evenly distributed . the dough will be damp and sticky ,
but no internal dry areas should appear by the end of the mixing . if
they do , mix a few minutes more or add a little more grape juice and
mix again .

2 ) let the dough rest 5 minutes . now sprinkle 1 or 2 tbsp . flour
over the dough and knead , either in the bowl or on a lightly floured
surface for 5-10 minutes , until the dough is smooth and elastic and
only slightly sticky . add more flour if needed . let the dough rest
2 minutes .

3 ) the dough should now be very smooth and easy to handle . knead 30
seconds more , return the dough to the bowl , cover the bowl with a dish
towel or large plate , and let rise at room temperature for at least 3
hours .

4 ) sprinkle top with flour , punch down , and form the dough into 4
rectangular loaves ( 4 in . by 2 in . by 2-1/2 in. ) . place two bay
leaves on the bottom of each loaf , and lay them , leaf side down , on a
greased cookie sheet . cover with a towel and let rise for 1 hour ,
until well risen .

5 ) bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 35 minutes , until the
loaves are brown on top and make a hollow sound when tapped on the
bottom . serve when cool . note : to make these breads without
leavening , omit the yeast , knead the dough thoroughly , then bake at
350 degrees for about 2 hours . they will be chewy and moist , and very
foreign to our taste . the romans thought unleaven bread was manlier
and much better for the digestion .

grandma mackay 's cranberry bread

breads , quick bread

2 cup flour , all-purpose
1 cup sugar , granulated
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 cup orange juice ( juice of one large or ; ange )
2 tablespoon shortening
1 tablespoon orange peel , grated ( one large oran ; ge )
1 egg , beaten
1 cup cranberries , halved or chopped
1 cup walnuts or pecans , chopped

preheat oven to 350 degrees f. grease the bottom , but not the sides , of
two small loaf pans .

in a large bowl , sift together all the dry ingredients ( flour , sugar ,
baking powder , baking soda and salt ) . blend very well .

mix together the orange juice , orange peel , melted shortening and beaten
egg . mix only enough to blend uniformly . mix in the cranberries and the
nuts ; stir gently . pour the mixture into the loaf pans . push it to the
corners , leaving the center slightly hollow .

bake about an hour at 350 degrees f. the loaves are done when a toothpick
inserted in the middle comes out clean . cool completely before cutting . do
not try to serve warm .

notes :

* a festive cranberry-orange nut-bread -- my grandmother mackay clipped
this recipe from the 1951 edition of the pillsbury bake-off competition
recipes , and we 've made it a family tradition ever since . from time to time
my mother and i have both tried to improve on the recipe , but it appears
that the recipe is already perfect ; every variation we have ever tried has
been disappointing by comparison .

when i was a boy , before the invention of the food processor , making this
bread required cutting the cranberries in half by hand , with a knife , and
the person who brought 4 loaves of cranberry bread to the family
thanksgiving meal was more welcome than the person who brought the turkey .
now , between baker 's secret loaf pans and cuisinart slicer blades , you can
knock out 8 perfect loaves of the stuff while watching one episode of
sesame street . my grandmother still cuts each cranberry in half with a
paring knife , and hers still tastes better than mine . yield : 2 small
loaves .

* it takes practice to know when to stop mixing the dough . if you mix too
much , the bread gets a chewy texture to it , whereas it should have a very
crumbly consistency , like a muffin or cornbread .

* it really makes a difference in the texture of this bread to use a
shortening that is solid at room temperature , like crisco . it really makes
a difference in the flavor to use fresh orange-peel and not powdered . i
prefer walnuts to pecans .

* it might seem sensible to try to use the same orange for the peel and
the juice , but it is really more trouble than it is worth to try to peel a
juiced orange or juice a peeled orange . i usually use two oranges and eat
the one that i took the peel from .

* this bread keeps well in the freezer . specifically , it keeps from
thanksgiving to christmas . it also survives quite well being mailed by
parcel post from indiana to maryland .

: difficulty : moderate .
: time : 10 minutes preparation if you have a food processor , 2 hours
baking and cooling .
: precision : measure carefully .

2 eggs
1/2 cup pumpkin ( canned )
4 tablespoon raisins or dried currants ; f

recipe by : better homes and gardens new crockery cooker in small bowl
combine flour , baking powder and pumpkin pie spice ; set aside .

in med . mixing bowl combine brown sugar and oil ; beat till well
combined . beat in eggs . add pumpkin ; mix well . add flour mixture .
beat just until combined . stir in raisins .

pour pumpkin mixture into 2 well-greased and floured 1/2-pint
straight-sided canning jars . cover jars tightly w/greased foil . place
a piece of crumpled foil in 3-1/2 or 4 qt . crockery cooker with liner
in place . place jars atop crumpled foil .

cover ; cook on high setting for 1-1/2 to 1-3/4 hours or until a
wooden toothpick inserted near centers comes out clean .

remove jars from cooker ; cool 10 minutes in jars . remove bread from
jars . cool thoroughly on wire rack .
makes 2 loaves .

for 3-1/2 to 4 quart crockpots -- halve all ingredients .

warning : use only canning jars for this recipe . others may not be
tempered to withstand the heat . do not use coffee or vegetable cans
as most contain lead and are painted or sealed with materials that
may give off toxic gases when heated .

this recipe does n't say you can seal them up and store them in your
pantry but my kerr canning book recipe says you can ; here 's how :

remove jars from the oven one at a time , wipe rim of jar clean ; put
on lid and ring and screw on tightly .

jars will seal as the cake cools . store like canned goods .

if you 'll be giving these as gifts , take a piece of decorative cloth
( about 1-inch larger in circumference than the lid or as large as
you 'd like ) and put it on top of the lid , then screw on the ring .
make sure you screw the lid on very tightly . i like to use pinking
shears to cut the cloth out with .

challah ii

breads , jewish

-- -- dough -- --
1/2 oz yeast ( active ) , dry ( 2 packages )
2 cup water , warm
4 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup sugar , granulated
3 large eggs
3/4 cup vegetable oil ( up to about 1/4 cup ; more , to taste )
9 cup flour , all-purpose ( more if needed )
-- -- glaze -- --
1 large egg
1 sesame or poppy seeds

mix yeast in warm water . let sit 5 minutes . in a large bowl combine salt ,
sugar , eggs and oil . add yeast mixture . slowly add flour , stirring until
not too sticky . when the dough becomes too thick to stir , turn it out onto
a floured board and knead , adding flour as necessary . scrape the working
surface with a plastic dough spatula from time to time , to keep a dry skin
from forming on it . you may find that you need more flour , but do n't add
too much more , or the dough will become heavy . knead until the dough is
smooth and elastic ( about 10 minutes ) .

form dough into a ball and place in a lightly oiled large bowl , turning to
coat the dough with oil . a ceramic bowl is best . cover the bowl with a
clean cloth and leave in a warm , draft-free place to rise for 1 1/2 hours ,
or until doubled in bulk . after the dough has risen , punch it down and
divide it into 6 balls . let the dough balls sit for 5 minutes , covered .

keeping dough balls covered while working , remove a ball and roll it
between your hands ( or on working surface ) into a cord about 1 inch wide by
about 20 inches long . the dough is quite elastic , making it nicely
workable , yet also tending to make it shrink back slightly after being
lengthened . i find it best to lengthen it in a series of passes . form 3
cords this way , and then start from the middle and braid them into a single
loaf . tuck the ends under . it 's a little harder to figure out how to start
braiding from the middle , but the loaves come out more even and attractive
that way . do n't pull the cords while braiding . place the loaf on a lightly
oiled baking sheet , and cover it with a cloth while you form the other
loaf . keep the loaves well apart on the baking sheet , since they will
expand a lot . cover the loaves and place again into a warm , draft-free
place to rise for 45-60 minutes .

after the loaves have risen , gently brush the tops with beaten egg using a
soft brush , and then sprinkle with the seeds . bake at 350 degrees f. for
30 minutes , or until golden brown .

notes :

* challah ( pronounced `` hallah '' ) is a type of braided egg bread
traditionally eaten on the jewish sabbath . it is eaten by tearing off hunks
rather than by cutting with a knife .

i got this recipe from a housemate a couple of years ago ; i do n't know its
origins before that , but it has become one of my favorite recipes , and one
with which i have experimented a good deal . i 've tried several other
challah recipes , but find i like this one the best . yield : 2 large loaves .

* the variation in oil makes quite a difference in the moisture of the
bread : if you use the larger quantity , the bread comes out very nice and
moist , but when it cools it becomes somewhat oily .

the amounts of sugar and oil may sound high , but try it this way once
before cutting back . i have tried other recipes that use less , and they
do n't taste nearly as good .

* here 's the fun part -- > variations . because this dough is so workable ,
you can form it many different ways , limited only by your imagination ; i
once made a whole collection of different shapes and sizes , for a festive
dinner party .

some of the variations i have tried include :

: o adding extra ingredients , such as raisins and/or nuts
: o forming the braided loaf into a wreath-like loop ( joining the ends )
: o braiding 5 ways instead of 3
: o baking a small loaf on top of a larger loaf ( traditional )
: o braiding 3 braided loaves into a recursive loaf ( did n't turn out
well ; it ended up looking knotty , rather than intricate , and being somewhat
tough )
: o varying the loaf sizes . one time i made individual-sized loaves , so
that everyone could have their own loaf at dinner . another time , i divided
the dough into 2 halves , set one aside , and made a loaf out of the other
half . then , i divided the remaining piece into 2 halves , and continued the
process until i had an array of loaves , each half the size of the previous .
i managed to get 9 loaves by doing this , the smallest of which was about
1/4 inch by about 2 inches .

: o varying the length-to-width proportions ; traditionally , challah
loaves are quite wide relative to their length . i find that shorter , wider
loaves are doughier ( and thus tastier ) , but longer loaves look more
elegant .

: difficulty : moderate .
: time : 30 minutes dough preparation , 1 1/2 hours first rising , 1 hour
loaf forming , 1 hour second rising , 30 minutes baking . total : 4 1/2 hours .
: precision : approximate measurement ok .

non / flat onion breads ( central asia )

breads , dumplings

6 tablespoon butter
1 1/2 cup onions -- finely chopped
3/4 cup water -- lukewarm
1 teaspoon salt
3 cup all-purpose flour

melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a heavy 10 to 12 inch skillet set
over high heat . add the onions , reduce the heat to low and , stirring
occasionally , cook 3 to 5 minutes , or until the onions are soft but
not brown . transfer them to a bowl and cool to room temperature .

melt the remaining butter in the skillet and pour it into a large
bowl . add the lukewarm ( 110 - 115 f ) water and , with a large spoon ,
stir in the chopped onions , salt and 2 1/2 cups of flour , 1/2 cup at
a time . if necessary , beat in as much of the remaining 1/2 cup of the
flour as you need to make a dough that does not stick to your
fingers . gather the dough into a large , compact ball and divide it
into 16 pieces . with the palms of your hands , shape each piece of
dough into a 1 1/2 to 2 inch ball . then , with a lightly floured
rolling pin , roll out the balls one at a time into circles that are
about 8 inches in diameter . set the rounds of dough aside .

set a heavy 10- to 12-inch ungreased pan over high heat . when it is
hot enough for a drop of water flicked across its surface to instantly
evaporate , place one round of dough in the center . brown for 3 or 4
minutes on each side , turning it over with your fingers or a wide
spatula ; do not be concerned if the bread does not brown evenly .

transfer the bread to a rack to dry and proceed to fry and dry the
remaining dough similarly . serve the bread in a basket or other
porous container . if for any reason the bread becomes limp after a
day or so , place the rounds in a single layer on a cookie sheet and
bake them for 5 to 10 minutes in a preheated 250f oven until they
freshen .

herman sourdough starter

breads

2 cup all-purpose flour
2 cup milk
1 cup sugar
1/3 cup warm water ( 115-120degrees )
2 pkg dry yeast

sprinkle 1 tablespoon of the sugar over the warm water . sprinkle
yeast over this and let stand in warm place to double in size ,
approximately 10 minutes .

mix milk , sugar , flour and yeast mixture in a plastic or glass
container , about the size of a 5 quart ice cream bucket .

stir , using only a wooden spoon as metal objects retard herman 's
natural growth . cover loosely with a clean cloth or place glass
plate over top of container so herman can breathe .

herman doubles , even triples at times of vigorous rising . place
herman in a warm place overnight . ( on top of refrigerator or in oven
with only the pilot light or electric oven light on . ) next day
refrigerate , loosely covered , and try to stir each day . yeast-type
mold may begin to form on the surface after 48 hours if you do n't
stir daily . on the fifth day , measure out 1 cup of herman to bake
with ( you can measure out more but you must have at least 1 cup of
herman left ) . then feed the herman you have left :
1 c all-purpose white flour ; 1 c milk ; 1/2 c sugar

stir well ! keep in refrigerator in the same large container , loosely
covered . stir every day . we have been away on vacation weekends
with no stirring and herman survived quite nicely . for longer
vacations , remember he freezes well !

on the tenth day , if you wish , measure out enough to bake another
recipe and start the process of feeding him once again . feed herman :

2 c all-purpose flour ; 2 cups milk ; 1 cup sugar

after the tenth day we start using herman almost daily , or as
desired , as we make most of our bread , cake and pancakes from herman .
as long as we remember to feed him approximately every 5 days he
survives very well . feed on days divisible by five-five , ten ,
fifteen , twenty , twenty-five , and thirty . you will never again
forget when to feed herman . if it 's a 5-day , feed herman !

if you are not using herman often , just add a tablespoon of sugar to
herman every fifth day and continue as long as forever ! ! herman is
such a sweetheart ( a sweet sourdough ) ! !

irish soda bread with herbs

breads , quick bread

1 from : the trellis cookbook
4 cup plus 1 tbsp bread flour
1 tablespoon fresh dill ; chopped
1 tablespoon fresh tarragon ; chopped
1 tablespoon fresh thyme ; chopped
1 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1 1/2 cup buttermilk
1/4 cup vegetable oil
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon ; water
1 variations :
1 scallion soda bread :
1/4 cup scallions ; thinly sliced , instead of
1 raisin soda bread :
1/3 cup raisins ; instead of herbs
1 caraway seed soda bread
2 tablespoon caraway seeds ; instead of herbs

preheat the oven to 325 degrees f. in the bowl of an electric mixer
fitted with a paddle , combine 4 cups flour , the chopped herbs , baking
powder , salt , and baking soda ( breaking up any lumps ) . mix on low
speed for 2 minutes . place the buttermilk and vegetable oil in a
stainless steel bowl and whisk gently to combine . gradually add the
buttermilk mixture to the combined dry ingredients while mixing on
low speed and continue to mix until the dough forms a ball , 30 to 40
seconds . scrape the dough away from the paddle and turn the dough
ball over . mix on low speed for an additional 30 seconds .

flour a clean , dry surface with the remaining tbsp flour . transfer the
dough ball to the floured surface and knead with the heels of your
hands until smooth . form the dough into a round loaf . pinch a small
handful of dough and gently twist , being careful not to tear the
dough from the loaf . place the loaf , pinched side down , on a baking
sheet lined with parchment paper .

whisk the egg yolk with 1 tbsp water , then lightly brush the mixture
over the top of the loaf . score the loaf by cutting a 1/4 '' deep `` x ''
into the top . bake the loaf in the preheated oven for 50 to 55
minutes . the bread is done if a hollow sound is heard when the bottom
is tapped with your finger . allow the bread to cool to room temp
before slicing .

notes - the dough must be kneaded vigorously by hand ; this should take
about 2 minutes . pinching and twisting the loaf to form a base will
give the finished bread a tighter and taller shape . this procedure is
not necessary ; however , the finished loaf will be much flatter if the
base is not pinched and twisted as suggested . rather than using dried
herbs , if fresh herbs are not available , use an equivalent amount of
chopped spinach . author - marcel desaulniers

1 cup flour , all-purpose ( important ! sift ; before measuring ! ! )

preheat oven to 425 degrees f. beat the eggs at high speed with an
electric mixer for 3 minutes , or until the mixture turns lemon yellow . slow
the mixer to a crawl and dribble in about 1/2 cup of milk , taking about 20
seconds to pour it in .

into another bowl , sift the flour and measure 1 cup as exactly as you can ,
sift 100 g flour then add salt and baking soda and sift again . with the
mixer still running on its slowest speed , add the dry ingredients to the
eggs and milk . turn the mixer off and use a rubber spatula to make sure
that all of the flour has blended in with the liquid .

set the mixer to medium speed and dribble in the remaining milk . blend for
1 minute . turn the mixer to its highest speed and beat for 10 minutes ( or 5
minutes if you have a kitchen-aid style mixer that uses a wire whip for
beating ) . extra beating ca n't hurt .

filter the batter through a fine-mesh screen strainer to remove any lumps ,
then pour into well-buttered popover cups or custard cups . ( if you must use

notes :

* popovers from the jordan pond teahouse -- in acadia national park , near
bar harbor maine , is jordan pond . a century ago the teahouse at jordan pond
was a gathering place where the aristocracy had tea and popovers with
strawberry jam each day at 4 o'clock .

the jordan pond tea house burned down in 1978 , but has been rebuilt . it now
serves people sporting clothes announcing `` mommy and daddy went to
naugatuck , and all they brought me was this crummy shirt , '' and who show up
in station wagons , but the popovers are the same that were served to the
idle rich of another era . yield : 2 large popovers .

* these popovers turn out significantly better if they are baked in
crockery custard cups rather than in metal or glass .

sour pumpernickel bread**

breads

1 cup sourdough starter
2 cup nonfat milk
2 tbl . blackstrap molasses
1/4 cup unsaturated oil
1 cup unbleached white flour
1 cup whole rye flour
2 cup whole wheat flour
1 second day prep :
1 tbl . salt
1 scant 1/2 tsp . baking soda
1/2 cup whole rye flour
1 1/2 cup to 2 c unbleached enriched white fl ; our
1 tablespoon caraway seeds
1/4 cup cornmeal
1 the glaze : optional
1 single egg yolk
1 tablespoon water
1 tablespoon caraway seeds

yield : 3 loaves the texture of this loaf is medium-light making is
perfect for sandwiches and toasting . the overnight rise makes this
pumpernickel easier to knead than most rye recipes . hints : spray the
loaves with water to develop a good thick crust . rye flour can make
for a heavy bread , so do n't force in more of the white flour than
required to handle the dough . if you do n't want the shininess or the
caraway seeds of the glaze , that step can be omitted .

sour pumpernickel bread first day prep : make up the sponge by
combining in a large bowl all the first-day ingredients , mixing in
the flour 1 cup at a time until the mixture is wet and smooth . cover
with a wet towel and allow to stand overnight in a draft free place .
at least 12 hours later , stir the sponge down to its original size .
sprinkle the salt and soda over the surface , then stir in . stir in
the rye flour . pour 1 c. of the white flour over your kneading
boards , scrape the batter onto it , and knead the flour in . then knead
in the caraway seeds . this dough never completely stops sticking , so
you can expect to use another 1/2 c. of white flour to sprinkle the
board and your hands as you knead for another 5 min . to achieve a
dough that can just be handled . grease two baking sheets and sprinkle
them with white cornmeal . tap the sheets to spread the cornmeal
evenly . divide the dough into thirds and shape into three oblong
loaves . place two loaves on one sheet and one loaf on the other ,
leaving room between the loaves for spreading . with a sharp knife or
single-edge razor , slash each loaf diagonally with three slashes , 1/4
to 1/2-inch deep . cover the loaves with a dry linen dish towel and
put into a warm , draft-free place to rise for 2-3 hours . the loaves
will look well risen and the slashes will gape wide . gently , slash
again into the same slashes , but only 1/8 '' deep . spray the loaves
with water . starting in a cold oven set at 375^ , bake for 40 minutes .
after the loaves have been in the oven for 10 min. , pull forward and
spray them again with water . after 30 min. , apply the glaze : mix the
egg yolk and water together , brush thinly over the loaves with a
pastry brush , then quickly sprinkle with caraway seeds . after 40
min. , when the loaves are =almost= done , shut off the oven and allow
to sit in the closed oven for another 10 minutes . this avoids
scorching . cool on a wire rack and serve warm .

3 teaspoon salt
2 pkg active dry yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1 cup ; warm water , ( 115 deg . f . )
10 1/2 cup unbleached all-purpose flour
2 large eggs

scald the milk in a 1-quart saucepan , over medium heat . meanwhile
combine the sugar , lard and salt in a large mixing bowl and set
aside . pour the milk over the sugar mixture and cool to lukewarm .
sprinkle the yeast and 1 ts of sugar over the lukewarm water ,

foamy ) . add the yeast mixture , 5 c of the flour , and the eggs to the
milk mixture . beat for 2 minutes , using an electric mixer set to
medium speed . gradually stir in enough of the remaining flour to make
a soft dough . note : the dough should be light and slightly sticky and
not heavy . this is very important because if you have to much flour
in the dough , the bread will not rise correctly . turn the dough out
and let rest while you wash , dry and lightly grease the mixing bowl .
knead the dough on a lightly floured surface until smooth and satiny ,
about 8 to 10 minutes . place the dough in the prepared bowl , turning
once to grease the top of the dough . cover and let rise in a warm

1 tablespoon ginger
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup white flour ; or unbleached

stand in warm place to double in size , about 10 minutes . mix milk ,
rest of honey or brown sugar , flours & yeast mixture in a glass
container , about the size of a gallon pyrex jar . stir , using only a
wooden spoon , since metal objects will retard herman 's growth . leave
the cover on loosely or place a glass plate over the top of the
container so herman can breathe . herman doubles , even triples at time
of vigorous rising . place herman in a warm place overnight . next day
refrigerate , loosely covered , and stir each day . this is very
important with wheat'n'honey herman starter as more gases form in the
container and are released during stirring . formation of this gas may
cause the starter to appear darker on top before stirring each day ,
but this is ok. on the 5th day measure out 1 c. herman for baking and
another cup to give to a friend , if you wish , then feed the herman
you have left , thusly : see above from day 5 on you may bake with
herman any day you wish , always making sure you have one full cup
left for feeding . feed herman every five days . if you have a lot
left , feed him only 1 t. honey or brown sugar . if you have one cup or
a little more left , add the same ingredients as you did on the 5th
day . when you share a cup of herman with friends they should feed
herman the same way . from news & observer , raleigh , n.c. 10/17/90

king arthur 's egg braid

breads

1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 cup warm water
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 cup warm milk
4 eggs , room temperature
1 stick butter or margarine
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 tablespoon cinnamon
7 cup 7-9 cups king arthur unbleached all ; -purpose flour
12 dyed uncooked eggs
-- -- egg wash -- --
1 egg , beaten
1 tablespoon water
1 pinch of salt

dissolve the yeast in the water . stir in the sugar and
add 1/2 cup flour . let this sit for 10-minutes to give
the yeast a chance to get going . add the milk , eggs ,
butter , salt , and cinnamon . stir in 4 cups of the
flour . add more flour until the dough starts to form a
shaggy mass . turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
counter and knead it , adding more flour as necessary ,
until the dough has formed a smooth and satiny ball .
the dough will be a little tacky , but it should n't be
sticky . put the dough into a clean bowl and coat it
with a little melted butter . this will help prevent
the formation of a skin on the dough due to exposure
to the air . cover the dough with plastic wrap or a
damp towel . let the dough rise in a warm spot for 1
1/2 to 2 hours , or until it 's quite swollen and puffy
looking . turn the dough out onto a lightly floured
counter and knead it gently to expel any air bubbles .
you do n't need to actively knead the dough at this
point ; that will excite the gluten in the dough and
make it harder to braid the bread . divide the dough
into 2 pieces and set one aside . divide the first
piece into 3 even pieces . roll each piece into a rope
that is 1 '' in diameter . braid the set of ropes and
shape the braid into a large circle . place the circle
on a greased or parchment paper-lined baking sheet .
repeat with the second piece of dough . cover the
loaves with damp towels and let the wreaths rise for
30 minutes . preheat the oven to 350 degrees . place the
eggs on the wreaths and gently press them into the
dough . brush the dough with the egg wash ( 1 egg beaten
with 1 tbs . water and a pinch of salt ) . bake the
loaves for 35-45 minutes , until nicely browned .
occasionally an egg will split in the oven . use a
sharp knife to remove it from the wreath and
substitute a dyed-hard-boiled egg . cool the wreaths on
a rack and ice when fully cool . makes 2 wreaths , each
yielding 12 large slices . icing glaze : 1 1/2 cups
confectioners ' sugar 3 tbs orange liqueur beat the
sugar and the liqueur together . the icing should be
the consistency of a thick salad dressing . use a fork
to drizzle the icing on the wreaths .

bread fat substitute - applesauce

breads

1 no ingredients

try substituting unsweetened applesauce for the fats called for in
your bread recipes . this even works with chocolate cake ! many ca n't
tell any difference in taste and the pectin in the applesauce keeps
the bread moist longer . i buy the small motts individual containers
so i do n't have a large jar going bad in the fridge . i 've read that
you can use up to one tablespoon of applesauce per cup of flour . if
you do make this substitution hold out about 1/8 to 1/4 cup of the
liquid in the recipe and add it back in a tsp . at a time during the
kneading cycle .

ukrainian almond crescents

breads , desserts

2 cup to 2 1/2 c unbleached white flour
1 pkg dry yeast ( about 1 tbs )
1 cup sweet butter , room temp
2 egg yolks , beaten
3/4 cup sour cream
1 filling :
2 cup almonds , toasted and coarsley groun ; d
2/3 cup to 3/4 c brown sugar , firmly packed
2 egg whites
1 pinch of salt

from `` sundays at moosewood restaurant . '' yields 24 pastries

rogaliki , which means `` little horns , '' are a specialty of the southern
ukraine . they are flaky pastries stuffed with sugar and nuts , and i
warn you , they can be addictive . although i am seldom interested in
sweets , these are `` devilish horns , '' tempting even me to eat just one
more !

pastry :

for the pastry , mix together the flour and yeast in a med bowl . cut
in the butter with a pastry fork until the mixture resembles coarse
meal . stir in the egg yolks and sour cream and mix well . the mixture
will still be crumbly . form the dough into a ball using your hands ,
working it as little as possible . the less you knead , the more
tender the pastry will be . the dough will be tacky . wrap it in waxed
paper and chill it for at least 2 hours .

prepare the filling by combining the ground almonds and sugar in a
small bowl . beat together the egg whites and salt until stiff , but
not dry , and carefully fold them into the nut mixture .

preheat the oven to 375f . when the dough is thoroughly chilled ,
divide it into three balls . using a floured rolling pin , roll out
three circles about 1/8 '' thick . work on a well-floured surface to
prevent the dough from sticking . cut each circle into eight
pie-shaped wedges and spread the wedges with the filling . starting at
the wide end , roll each wedge up like a little croissant and then
pull the ends into a curve to form a `` horn . '' make sure the point is
on the bottom so the `` horns '' will not open up while baking .

place the almond crescents on a lightly oiled baking sheet and bake
for about 30 - 40 min , until golden and puffed .

3 oz plain flour
1 teaspoon salt ( or slightly less )

and leave to stand in a warm place for 20 mins . stir again and cook
in a stong , well greased frying pan . pour in enough batter to cover
the base fairly thinly and trun out when cooked .

remarks : this recipe is heavily adapted , but works . traditionally the
oat cakes were cooked on a ` backstone ' - a stone or iron sheet , over
an open fire . it is still possible in some places in yorkshire to buy
a ` girdle ' , a cast iron sheet , about 12 in diameter , with a hoop
handle - these are ideal . when cooked , the oatcakes where hung on
plain wooden rack suspended from the ceiling , known as bread fleaks .
the oatcakes were eaten either fresh or dried .

they can be fried with bacon , or suttered and eaten alone with cheese ,
treacle , golden syrup etc .

* pumpkin scones -- scones ( pronounced with a short ` o ' , rhymes with
` fonz ' ) are a popular accompaniment to afternoon tea . they are often served
with jam and whipped cream . in this variation the scones are flavoured with
pumpkin . it is not a typical scone recipe .

pumpkin scones can be eaten in place of bread with a meal . this recipe was
made famous by the wife of the premier of queensland . yield : serves 4-6 .

* to an australian , a pumpkin is a large round , squat , green or blue-green
vegetable that is orange on the inside . there are many varieties , all of
species cucurbita maxima . in north america a good substitute is acorn
squash ( cucurbita pepo ) ; elsewhere a butternut squash ( caryoka nuciferum )
would be a fair substitute .

1 tablespoon sesame seeds
1 tablespoon fresh sage ; chopped
1 tablespoon fresh basil ; chopped
1/2 teaspoon dill ; dried
1 egg ; beaten
2 tablespoon butter ; melted
1/2 cup pine nuts
4 cup all-purpose flour

combine the yeast , honey and salt with 1 cup lukewarm ( not hot ) water
and set aside . ( remember : if the water is too hot it will kill the
growing yeast . )

heat 1 cup water to boiling , and add the oatmeal and sour cream .
simmer , covered , for 10 minutes , then remove from the heat and cool
to lukewarm . combine the whole-wheat flour , seeds , and herbs in a
large mixing bowl . add the oatmeal and yeast mixtures and beat until
well blended . add beaten egg and melted butter and beat several times
again . add the pine nuts , then add 3 cups of the all-purpose flour ,
one cup at a time , beating between each addition until a fairly stiff
dough is developed .

spread the remaining all-purpose flour on a board and knead the dough
into it thoroughly , about a dozen times , then put the dough in a
large , well-greased bowl and cover with a damp cloth . set to rise in
a warm place until double its original bulk ( about 1 hour ) .

just before the end of the rising time , presoak 2 clay pots , top and
bottom , in hot water for 15 minutes . ( we use 2 pots in order to bake
each loaf separately . )

place the risen dough on a floured board , divide , and shape into 2
loaves . before putting the loaves in the presoaked pots , put a small
piece of aluminum foil , just large enough to cover the bottom of the
loaf , on the bottom of each pot . ( this keeps the bread from sticking
to the pot . ) place the dough inside the pots , cover , and allow to
rise until almost doubled in bulk ( about 45 minutes ) . ( i wrapped the
pot in a wet towel to keep it from drying out too soon . )

cover the pots and put them in a cold oven .

set the oven temperature at 480 degrees . bake for 40 minutes . if
necessary , remove lid for the last 5 minutes of baking to get a
golden brown crust .

note : this is the best bread i 've made in a long time . high loaf ,
light , and with a very crisp crust and moist inside . pine nuts do n't
add much to it and could be left out . had a problem with it sticking
to the pot ( my clay pot has a semi-glazed bottom which i greased very
lightly with shortening , and it still stuck in spots ) .

2 tablespoon sugar

mix the whole wheat flour throughly with the white flour . rub the
butter into the flours . add the salt , and soda .

make a well in the center and gradually mix in the liquid . stir with a
wooden spoon . you may need less , or more liquid - it depends on the
absorbent quality of the flour . the dough should be soft but
managable .

hands .

put in on a lightly floured baking sheet and with the palm of your
hand flatten out in a circle 1 1/2 inches thick . with a knife dipped
in flour , make a cross through the center of the bread so that it
will easily break into quarters when it is baked .

bannock

breads , canadian

1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup all purpose flour
1/2 cup rolled oats
2 tablespoon sugar , granulated
2 teaspoon baking powder salt
2 tablespoon butter , melted
1/3 cup raisins ; optional water ; approx ,

`` bannock , a simple type of scone was cooked in pioneer days over open
fires . variations in flours and the additional of dried or fresh
fruit make this bread the simple choice of canadian campers even
today . oven baking has become an acceptable alternative to the cast
iron fry pan . mckelvie 's restaurant in halifax serves an oatmeal
version similar to this one . for plain bannock , omit rolled oats and
increase the all purpose flour to 1 cup ... . one of the earliest quick
breads , bannock was as simple as flour , salt , a bit of fat ( often
bacon grease ) and water . in gold rush days , dough was mixed right in
the prospector 's flour bag and cooked in a fry pan over an open fire .
indians wrapped a similar dough around sticks driven into the ground
beside their camp fire , baking it along with freshly caught fish .
today 's native _fried bread_ is like bannock and cooked in a skillet .
newfoundlander 's _damper dogs_ are small rounds of dough cooked on
the stove 's dampers while _toutons_ are similar bits of dough deep
fried . at a promotional luncheon for the 1992 inuit circumpolar
conference , eskimo doughnuts , deep fried rings of bannock dough , were
served . it is said that inuit children prefer these `` doughnuts '' to
sweet cookies .
red river settlers from scotland made a frugal bannock with lots of
flour , little sugar and drippings or lard . now this same bread plays a
prominent part in winnipeg 's own folklorama festival .
at expo '86 in vancouver , buffalo on bannock buns was a popular
item at the north west territories ' restaurant . in many regions of
canada , whole wheat flour or wheat germ replaces part of the flour
and cranberries or blueberries are sometimes added . a saskatchewan
firm markets a bannock mix , and recipe books from coast to coast
upgrade bannock with butter , oatmeal , raisins , cornmeal and dried
fruit . ''

stir together flours , oats , sugar , baking powder and salt . add melted
butter , raisins ( if using ) and water , adding more water if needed to
make sticky dough . with floured hands , pat into greased pie plate .
bake in 400f oven for 20 to 25 minutes or until browned and tester
comes out clean . cut into wedges . serves:6 variations : in place of
raisins add chopped dried apricots or fresh berries . ( blueberries are
terrific if one is camping in northern ontario in august . )

recipe by : kkpd13b linda caldwell i 've found another interesting
quote from donna german regarding the feeding and care of your
sourdough starter . `` if you 're using the culture every month or so ,
you do n't have to feed it at all . if the relationship sours , so to
speak , and you decide to break it off for a while , the question of
maintenance comes up in case you patch things > > over and want to
have another `` wild fling '' store the culture in a refrigerator , and
then warm it up and feed it about once every 6 months . the longer it
lies dormant , the more tlc is needed to bring it back . feeding every
12 hours for 3 to 4 days with vigorous stirring will always rescue
it . '' my particular starter is staging a nice comeback right now .

basic crumpet

breads

1 pkg active dry yeast
1 or 1 cake compressed yeast
1/4 cup water*
2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon butter or margarine
1 cup milk , scalded
1 egg
3 cup all purpose flour

degree ) for compressed yeast .

sprinkle dry yeast or crumble cake yeast into water . let stand for a
few minutes ; then stir until dissolved . add sugar , salt , and butter
to warm milk , stirring to dissolve ; cool to lukewarm . add egg , yeast
mixture and flour and beat thoroughly . let batter rise in warm place
for 30 minutes ; with spoon beat for 3 minutes .

repeat rising and beating and then rising again .

pour batter into greased 4 inch muffin rings on medium hot greased
griddle ( 325 degrees on electric griddle ) filling rings one third
full .

bake until well risen and browned on one side . turn over , rings and
all , and brown on other side ( should take about 18 to 20 minutes )

grated raw potato starter

breads , potatoes

1 cup warm water
1 teaspoon sugar
1 1/2 cup white flour
1 medium grated potato
1 teaspoon salt

mix the 1 cup warm water , 1-1/2 cups white flour and 1 tsp . each salt
and sugar in a 2-cup measure . add enough grated potato to make 2
cups . place in a wide mouth glass jar or small mixing bowl ( do not
use metal or plastic ) which will hold about 1 quart . cover with a
single thickness of cheesecloth to allow wild yeast from the air to
settle into it for 24 hours . stir well , cover tightly with a
clinging transparent wrap which will cause the moisture to drip back
and keep top of mixture from drying . stir several times a day . in two
or three days it will become foamy and very light . ( the length of
time depends on temperature . 80 ~85 is ideal . it can go a little
below 80 without harm , only slowing the procedure a little , but if it
goes much higher than 85 it will be spoiled . ) then stir well , pour
into glass jar with screw-top lid and store in refrigerator at about
38 degrees . as soon as 1/2 inch of clear liquid has risen to the top
it has ripened enough to start using . do not be concerened if the
mixture turns dark because of the raw potato during the fermentation
period . it does not affect the bread made from it in any way and as
soon as the starter is mature , it will become a snowy white . to renew
starter : add 1-1/2 cups white flour and 1-1/2 cups water each time it
is used so that there are always 2 cups to bake with and 2 full cups
to return to refrigerator . if for some reason it can not be used
regularly about twice a week , add 1 tsp . sugar and stirr well every
three or four days .

czech dumplings

breads

1 pkg yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 cup milk ; scalded and cooled
1 cup milk ; warm
1 egg
1/2 teaspoon salt
3 1/2 cup flour
3 slices white bread ; cubed

there are a number of different kinds of dumplings in the czech
cuisine , but if you are serving a pork roast with sauerkraut , i
recommend bread dumplings . make sure you use the drippings from the
roast to make gravy for these ! mix the first three ingredients , let
stand for 10 minutes . mix the warm milk , egg , salt , yeast mixture and
flour . add the bread cubes . knead the resulting dough just as you
would when making bread . let the dough rest in a warm place to rise .
it should double in about 2 hours . knead again ; divide into 3 long
rolls , each about 1 1/2 `` thick . let rise another 1/2 hour . drop the
rolls of dough , one at a time , into a large kettle of boiling water .
boil gently for about 15 minutes . remove with slotted spoons and
place on a buttered platter . keep warm . when ready to serve , slice
the rolls into individual slices by using a length of thread . loop it
around one dumpling and pull tight to slice off a piece about 2 ''
thick . ( this is the fun part ! you can get pretty good at this
garrotting if you practice ! ! ) you should end up with about 2 dozen
slices . my cookbook says , `` these freeze well - steam before serving . ''
( i 've never tried that ! ! ) if you would prefer potato dumplings to
these , just say so . the only problem with them is they sometimes get
a bit `` slimy '' or mushy . i like them that way , but they do n't look as
presentable as the bread dumplings .

3 1/4 cup unbleached white flour
1 teaspoon baking powder
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 3/4 cup plain yogurt
1 unsalted butter ( optional ) - soften ; ed

sift the flour , baking powder , and salt into a bowl . slowly add as
much yogurt as you need to gather the flour together and make a soft ,
resilient dough . knead for about 10 minutes and form a ball . put the
ball in a bowl and cover the bowl with a damp dishcloth . set aside in
a warm place for 1-1/2 to 2 hours . knead the dough again and divide
into nine equal parts . keep them covered .

heat a cast-iron skillet or griddle over a lowish flame , and preheat
the broiler .

take one of the parts of dough and make a ball out of it . flatten it
and then roll out on a lightly floured surface until you have a round
that is about 1/8 inch thick . when the skillet is very hot , pick up
the naan and slap it onto the heated surface . let it cook slowly for
about 4 to 5 minutes . now put the skillet under the broiler for 1 to
1-1/2 minutes or until the puffing-up process is complete and there
are a few reddish spots on the naan . remove the naan with a spatula
and brush with butter if you like . make all the naans this way ,
keeping them stacked and covered with a clean dishcloth . serve hot .

if you wish to have the naans later , wrap them in a plastic bag when
they have cooled . before you eat , wrap as many as you need in
aluminum foil and heat in an oven at 400 f for 15 minutes .

xiao long tang bao*

breads , pork , chinese

11 oz pork loin with some fat , chopped or ; ground coarse
2 teaspoon soy sauce
1 tablespoon sesame oil
2 tablespoon scallion greens , chopped
1 1/2 teaspoon ginger root , chopped fine
6 tablespoon water
1/4 cup stiff aspic ( jellied stock )
1/4 recipe basic yeast dough

the chinese for this dish can be transliterated as anything from `` show
loong tong bow '' to `` hsiao lung t'ang pao '' to xiao long tang bao*
little juicy steamed rolls ... juicy steamed buns with pork

mix first 8 ingredients . divide into 24 portions . cut aspic into 24
portions . knead dough 5 min ; roll out into a thin baguette ; cut into
24 pieces . flatten each piece into a 2 '' round ; then go around with
your fingers and squeeze the edges thin - the result should be a
medium-thin center and a thin outside . put 1 portion ( 1/2 oz ) filling
in the center of each round ; top with 1 portion of aspic . bring up
the sides of each round and twist up in a decorative pattern , making
sure to seal the top . if holes appear , patch them at once !

put each dumpling on a square of waxed paper or a piece of bok choy
leaf and steam , preferably in a bamboo steamer , for 8 min . serve hot .

note on aspic :

if you do n't have any on hand , use about 1 1/2 c of homemade chicken
broth ( or good-quality canned low-salt broth ) : boil 1 c of broth ,
uncovered , for about 2 min ( reducing it quite a bit ) while dissolving
1 envelope gelatin in the other 1/2 c. mix together and stir over low
heat until all gelatin is dissolved . chill . this will make a hard
aspic , enough for 3 recipes of this dim sum .

quick sourdough starter

breads

2 cup flour
1 tablespoon yeast ( 1 package )
1 1/2 cup water 105 - 115 deg . f .

about 10 minutes . if the yeast does n't start to puff up and bubble ,
discarded and start over with fresh yeast .

sprinkle the flour into the yeast mixture and beat into a thick
batter . the batter does n't have to be too smooth as the action of the
yeast will break down any lumps . cover the bowl with plastic wrap and

until it is nice and frothy . you can use the starter right away or
let it age for up to 3 days longer to develope a richer flavor . store
starter in fridge between uses and use or replenish every two weeks .

you can use any flour or combination of flours to make the starter ;
some rye and buckwheat added to all-purpose makes a nice blend .

to replenish the starter : mix equal parts of water and flour ( about a
cup of each is good ) and add to the starter at least every two weeks .
let the starter age in a warm place for 6 to 24 hours , then use or
return to the fridge .

injera ( ethiopian flat bread )

breads , vegetarian

1 3/4 cup flour
1/2 cup self-rising flour
1/4 cup whole wheat flour
1 pkg dry yeast
2 1/2 cup water ; warm
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt

combine the flours and yeast in a ceramic or glass bowl . add the warm
water and mix into a fairly thin , smooth batter .
let the mixture sit for three full days at room temperature .
stir the mixture once a day . it will bubble and rise . when you are
ready to make the injera , add the baking soda and salt and let the
batter sit for 10-15 minutes . heat a small , nonstick 9-inch skillet .
when a drop of water bounces on the pan 's surface , take about 1/3 cup
of the batter and pour it in the skillet quickly , all at once . swirl
the pan so that the entire bottom is evenly coated , then return to
heat . the injera is cooked only on one side and the bottom should not
brown . when the moisture has evaporated and lots of `` eyes '' appear on
the surface , remove the injera . let each injera cool and then stack
them as you go along . if the first injera is undercooked , try using
less of the mixture , perhaps 1/4 cup , and maybe cook it a bit longer .
be sure not to overcook it . injera should be soft and pliable so that
it can be rolled or folded , like a crepe .

roti ( flat whole-wheat bread )

breads , digest

2 cup chappati flour
1 or
1 cup whole-wheat flour mixed w/
1 cup cake flour
1 additional flour for
1 dusting

put the flour in a bowl . slowly add enough water so that you will be
able to gather the flour together and make a soft dough . you may need
about 2 1/2 tablespoons less than a cup of water . knead the dough for
7 to 8 minutes or until it is smooth . make a ball and put it inside
a bowl . cover the bowl with a damp dishcloth and set it aside for
half an hour .

if the dough looks very runny , flour your hands and knead for another
few minutes . form twelve equal balls and dust each with a little
flour . keep them covered .

set a cast-iron griddle or skillet to heat over a medium-low flame .
allow at least 5 minutes for that . keep about a cup of dusting flour
near you . remove a ball of dough and flatten it between the palms of
your hands . dust it on both sides with flour . roll it out , as thinly
and evenly as you can , aiming for a 5 1/2 inch round . when the
griddle is hot , slap the roti onto its heated surface . cook for
about a minute or until soft bubbles begin to form . turn the roti
over . cook for half a minute on the second side .

if you have a gas fire , light a second burner on a medium flame and
put the roti directly on it . using tongs , rotate the roti so that
all areas are exposed to the shooting flames . take 5 seconds to do
this . turn the roti over and repeat for about 3 seconds . the roti
should puff up . put the roti on a plate and cover with a towel . make
all roti this way .

if you have an electric stove , place the griddle and roti under a
broiler for a few seconds , until the roti puffs up . serve hot .

chapatis

breads

1 1/2 cup flour , unbleached
1/2 cup flour , whole wheat
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon ghi
1/2 cup ; water

mix flours , salt , and butter and add just enough water to make a firm
dough , somewhat like a biscuit dough . knead for 10-15 minutes - the
more the dough is kneaded , the lighter the bread will be . shape the
dough into a ball , cover with a sheet of plastic and let it rest for
at least 1 hour . if left to rest overnight in the refrigerator , the
finished bread will be even lighter . when ready to bake , take a small
piece of dough about the size of a golf ball , or a bit smaller . on a
lightly floured board , roll the dough into a thin circle , about 5
inches in diameter . repeat with all the dough . heat a griddle or
heavy-bottomed iron skillet until it is very hot ( you will notice the
smoke rising from it ) . place the rolled out chapati on the griddle
and let it cook for 2-3 minutes , depending on how thin you have
rolled it . using a pair of kitchen tongs , you can lift the chapati to
see if the underside has turned a golden brown . flip , and cook the
other side about 1 minute . as they are cooked , store the chapatis on
a towel in a warm covered container until ready to serve . serve as
soon as the last chapati is baked . note : in india breads sometimes
are baked in the fiery clay tandoor , where they develop brown spots
and bubbles . to achieve a similar effect at home , you can use tongs
to hold each chapati over a hot gas flame until it puffs like a
little balloon . the chapati will collapse as it cools .

2 tablespoon molasses or caramel
2 tablespoon lard or vegetable fat , melted
2 tablespoon crushed caraway seeds
1 tablespoon salt
3 cup rye flour
2 1/2 cup to 3 cups white flour , preferably u ; nbleached

makes 2 round loaves in a large bowl dissolve the yeast in the warm
water . stir in the beer , molasses , lard , caraway seeds , salt , rye
flour , and enough white flour until the dough becomes difficult to
stir . turn the dough out onto a floured working surface and let rest
while you clean out and grease your bowl . knead the dough , adding
more white flour as necessary ; it will be very tacky , but up to 3
cups of white flour in all and about 8-10 minutes of kneading should
be enough . return the dough to the greased bowl , cover with plastic
wrap , and let rise until double in volume - about 2 hours . turn the
dough out , punch it down , and form into 2 rounds . place far apart on
a greased baking sheet sprinkled with corn meal . let rise covered
with a towel until double - about 45 minutes . if you have tiles or a
baking stone , heat the oven well ahead to 375 f to warm them , and to
get a good crust use a device to create steam . if you do n't want to
bother with a steaming device , brush the loaves with cold water
before they go in the oven and again two or three times during the
first 10 minutes . if you have tiles or a baking stone , slip the
loaves directly onto the hot surface ; otherwise simply bake the
loaves on the baking sheet . after 10 minutes reduce the heat to 350 f
and bake another 40 minutes . cool on racks .

pugliese bread

breads , italian

1/4 cup water
1 1/4 teaspoon yeast
13/16 cup starter ( biga )
2 1/4 cup water
1 tablespoon salt
1 teaspoon salt
7 1/2 cup flour

mix water and yeast together . let stand for 10 mins . add biga
( starter ) and water . mix until creamy looking . it is not necessary
to get rid of strands of starter that occur .

add all of the salt . stir until desolved .

add flour . mix 2-3 minutes ( electric mixer ) or mix 4-5 minutes ( by
hand ) .

dough will just barely pull away from sides of bowl . it should be very
sticky . adjust water and/or flour as necessary .

let rise in a lightly oiled bowl for 3+ hours , covered tightly with
lightly oiled plastic wrap . dough will triple in volume .

divide dough into four parts .

roll each part into long strand . roll up along length , stretching
slightly . turn dough sideways and roll to long string again . roll up
into tight ball , tucking to ends under .

let rise 1 hour , covered with towel .

pre-heat oven to 450 , with pan of water in the oven , about 20 minutes
before baking .

lightly dust loaves with flour and place on flat cookie sheet .

caution : the oven will be steamy when opened .

bake with pan of water for 15 minutes . remove water pan .

bake 20 more minutes . loaf should sound hollow on bottom . on of the
best ways to eat this bread is by rubbing a slice with garlic , or
sprinkling with crushed fresh garlic or garlic powder . then drizzle
virgin olive oil over the bread . follow this with a light sprinkle of
parmesan cheese .

bread dough can be wrapped in plastic at any of the stages before
baking and frozen or refrigerated . unfreeze and allow to thaw
completely . this seems to work best if done before the rolling of the
individual loaves .

if stored in refrigerator , allow ample room , as bread will rise in the
refrigerator !

let the doughnuts rest and rise for 20 minutes uncovered . bake about
10 minutes or a little longer , until they have a touch of golden
brown . remove from the oven . have ready the melted butter and a
brush . on a sheet of wax paper , spread the cinnamon sugar . brush each
doughnut and doughnut hole with butter and roll in the cinnamon

greek tsoureki ( easter bread )

breads , holiday , greek

1 cup milk
1/2 cup sweet butter
1 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 cup granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
2 eggs ; beaten
5 tablespoon orange juice
1 tablespoon grated orange rind
5 1/2 cup sifted flour
1 butter ; melted
1 red-dyed , hard-boiled eggs
1/4 cup slivered almonds
2 tablespoon granulated sugar

in a small saucepan , combine the milk and butter over medium heat and
scald . stir until the butter melts , then pour into a mixing bowl .
when lukewarm , sprinkle in the yeast , and with fingers or a heavy
spoon gradually stir in the 1/2 cup sugar until it dissolves . then
add the salt , eggs 3 tablespoons of the orange juice , and the orange
rind , stirring continuously , and gradually add half the flour until
the mixture begins to bubble . continue adding flour gradually by
hand ; the dough will be sticky , but should not be stiff . flour your
fingers lightly and knead for 15 minutes . place the dough in a large
buttered bowl , brush the dough with melted butter , cover , and place
in a warm area to rise until doubled in bulk ( approximately 2 to 3
hours ) .
punch the dough down and divide into 2 parts . divide each half
into 3 parts and roll each into a long rope about 10 '' x 2 '' . braid
the three ropes together ; pinch to seal the ends if leaving long , or
join together to form a long round loaf ( see note below ) . repeat
with the other half of the dough to make a second tsoureki . place in
large baking pans or on a cookie sheet , cover , and let rise until
doubled in bulk ( approx . 1 1/2 hours ) .
meanwhile , prepare the glaze by mixing the remaining orange juice ,
remaining sugar , and the almonds in a small bowl . bake the tsourekia
in a 375 degree oven for 20 minutes . remove from the oven and with a
pastry brush glaze the tops and sides of loaves . return to the oven
and bake for another 15 to 20 minutes until the color is a rich and
shiny chestnut .
note : if using the easter eggs , tuck them into the center when you
shape the loaves , leave until loaves have doubled and bake them with
the loaf . after baking , though lovely , the eggs will be inedible .
also in some provinces , the tsoureki is formed with a large braid and
a smaller one over it , making a much larger loaf requiring a longer
baking time .

2 tablespoon buttermilk powder

2 teaspoon wheat germ
1/2 teaspoon ginger
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 tablespoon honey
1/2 cup whole wheat s/d starter ( you
1 cup water ; ( i use bottled h20 )
1/2 margarine , room temp .

i used the whole wheat starter and experimented with your whole wheat
bread recipe in the dak today . it turned out great . basically , i just
halved your recipe and added a few things . my dak is a 3 cup flour
model , is yours ? if i 'm using whole wheat or rye flour , i can add
more flour because it does n't rise as much . also , whenever i use
whole wheat , etc . i add vital wheat gluten and lecithin to aid
elasticity and to help it rise . this is what i put in the dak and the
order i used : turn the light/dark setting to 12 o'clock and set the
menu to sweet bread ( the auto . one , not the manual one ) later , at the
beeps , i added 3/4 c. pecans ( did n't have walnuts on hand ) . i usually
add large pieces since they are kind of cut up by the b/m while knead
ing . we can keep experimenting with this ... .let me know if you try it
and what you add or subtract . have you ever added raisins , oatmeal or
any kind of seeds ? the b/m gives me the lazy way out , and i wanted to
see what it would do in it . thanks so much for taking precious time
to post the recipe . p.s . i have some of the beer s/d starter to give
you when we get together , but the whole wheat starter is great ! .

breadsticks with black pepper & cheddar

breads , cheese

2 1/2 cup unbleached flour plus
1/2 cup ( approximately for kneading
1/2 cup whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/2 tablespoon active dry yeast
1 pinch sugar ( generous )
1 1/2 cup ; warm water
2 tablespoon vegetable oil
2 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper
3 scallions ; sliced thin - ( abt . 1/4
1 cup grated cheddar cheese
1 egg white ; lightly beaten - with 1
1 cornmeal
1 kosher salt ( opt'l . )

in a mixing bowl , combine 1 1/2 c. of the unbleached flour with the
whole wheat flour and salt . make a well in the flour and add yeast ,
sugar and 1/2 c. of the warm water . let yeast stand until foamy ,
about 5 to 10 minutes .

stir in another 1/2 c. water and the oil . add remaining water and
stir the batter vigorously with a wooden spoon . add 1/2 c. flour and
beat well . stir in the pepper , scallions , cheese and another 1/2 c .
flour ; blend well .

sprinkle about 1/4 c. of the flour for kneading on a pastry board or
marble and turn the dough out onto it . knead , adding the rest of the
flour as needed , until the dough is smooth and homogeneous and
springs back when pressed with your thumb . the dough will be
slightly sticky , but should not be too sticky . add a bit more flour
if necessary .

cover the dough with a clean , dry tea towel and let it rest 5 to 10
minutes . roll it into a cylinder about 20 to 24 '' long and cut the
cylinder into about 20 pieces with a sharp knife . let the pieces
rest , covered , for 5 minutes .

lightly oil two baking sheets and sprinkle them lightly with
cornmeal . roll each piece of dough into a cylinder about 10 '' long and
3/4 '' wide , and place ten of them on each baking sheet . if you prefer
smaller breadsticks , cut each one in half crosswise .

preheat the oven to 350 f. and set the baking sheets , covered with
clean tea towels , in a warm place to rise . gas ovens generate a
warmth while preheating which is just right for raising the dough ;
just turn the baking sheets occasionally to ensure even heat . if you
have an electric oven , choose a different place for raising . let the
sticks rise 25 to 30 minutes , until they have increased in size by
about 50 percent .

with a sharp knife , make five or six diagonal slashes on top of each
breadstick . brush them lightly with the egg white and water mixture .
sprinkle very lightly with salt , if desired .

bake breadsticks for 20 to 25 minutes ( 16 to 20 minutes if you 've cut
them in half ) , changing the position of the baking sheets on the oven
racks about halfway through baking time . the breadsticks should be
golden brown .

eat them right away or let them cool and store them in tightly closed
tins ; wrapped tightly , they can be stored in the freezer for up to a
month . wrap them in foil and gently reheat at 300 f. for 10 to 12
minutes ( slightly longer if frozen ) before serving .


belsinger and dille write : `` more like small baguettes than the
completely dry commercial breadsticks , these have a crisp crust and a
chewy , bready interior . they have a nice , lingering , peppery
aftertaste that complements most soups and salads , and aperitifs or
cocktails , and they 're excellent party fare . ''

notes :

a tortilla press is a cast iron press for pressing corn tortillas and
tamales into flat thin circles . [ one could probably use a ( cold )
round waffle iron , assuming that it has a flat ( pancake ) side in
addition to the bumpy ( waffle ) side . ]

masa is freshly ground daily at tortilla factories . corn is soaked
in lime water and then cooked and rinsed before grinding . lime aids
as a preservative and adds color . fresh masa is best for tamales and
corn tortillas , but instant masa is also available .

crock pot quick breads & cakes ( info )

breads , crockpot

1 set of instructions
1 breads & cake

: there are a few tricks to remember when `` baking '' in one of these
pots . first , turn the control to high ( or to the setting which is
equivalent to the high used in the recipes ) . the low setting is too
low to give breads and cakes the texture you expect . :
with breads , remember to cover the container with a lid or foil .
tie the lid or foil onto the container and place the container on a
meal rack or trivet inside the pot . if you do n't have a metal rack or
trivet to fit your slow cooker , crumple foil and place it in the
bottom of the pot to support the baking container . pour 2 cups of hot
water around the container to provide steam for cooking the bread . :
when using a deep fryer type of slow cooker , check frequently to
make sure the water has n't evaporated . add more water if needed .
: in general , it is not a good idea to remove the lid or foil from
the bread container during the first 2 hours of cooking . after that ,
check the bread by inserting a toothpick in the mixture . if the
toothpick comes out clean , the bread is done .
: when using a standard cake mix , the procedure is slightly
different . cakes are `` baked '' in a pan set directly on the bottom of
the slow cooker , similar to the way you would do it in an oven . [ you
do ? ? ? -- kl ] : it is not necessary to use a trivet or water .
instead of covering the uncooked cake mixture with foil or a lid ,
cover the top with four or five layers of paper towels . because
there is more mosture in a slow cooker than in an oven , it is
necessary to compensate for this with the paper towels to help absorb
the moist top of the cake mix . also , leave the lid of your slow
cooker slightly open to let extra moisture escape . : the type and
kind of container to use for breads and cakes will depend on the size
of your pot . the following containers hold equivalent amounts of
batter , and so will substitute for each other :

coffee can , 2 lb two coffee cans , 1 lb mole , 6-7 cup
capacity baking dish , 1 1/2 quart three vegetable cans , 16 oz

souffle dishes and springform pans also work , when they fit in the
pot .

6 oz dried fruit
8 oz dark brown sugar
1/2 pint strong hot tea
10 oz self-raising flour
1 egg

this is wales ' traditional rich fruit bread . south wales makes it
with baking powder ; northerners prefer yeast as the raising agent .
either way it 's delicious .

soak the dried fruit and sugar overnight in the tea . you can use
either fresh tea , or the cold dregs from the teapot ( this gives a
good strong colour ) . next day , sieve the flour and fold it it into
the fruit . mix in the lightly beaten egg . line a small loaf-tin with
buttered paper then tip in the mixture , smoothing it well into the
corners .

bake in a gentle oven at 300 f ( 150 c ) gas mark 2 for 1 1/2 hours .
cool and store for at least 2 days in a tin so that it matures moist
and rich . traditionalists say you should never butter the bara brith ,
but dorothy says do , as it 's lovely that way .

1 1/2 cup bread flour

*i may have used only 1 tablespoon of the oil ( ca n't remember ) .

since i like a lighter crust , i made this in my zoji on the `` basic
white bread '' setting with baking degree set on `` light , '' instead of on
the `` raisin bread setting . '' i floured the raisins and added them 30
minutes after the kneading started .

i know i had to add additional water , until the dough `` looked right , ''
but i did n't measure it . i may have added as much as one-fourth cup .

this made a beautiful loaf ... .almost to the top of the pan . the next
time i make it , i 'll try to remember to write down the amounts !

sylvia 's comments : this came out great except that the dough looked
too dry , so i added a tiny bit more water and it overrose , with a
texture a little too coarse to suit me . next time i 'll just use the
amount of water called for .

if you do n't want whole wheat , but prefer a white bread base ,
substitute 3-1/2 cups bread or ap flour for the 2 cups whole wheat
and the 1-1/2 cups bread or ap flour measurements .

more than half full . preheat the skillet by putting it into the oven

cornbread with the top not cooked as dark as the sides and bottom .

slightly and cut into squares , then serve warm . this is a trial and
error deal to suit your own taste for sweetness , adjust sugar as you
want , and crustiness . do n't want crust all over ? then do n't use
prehotted cast iron skillet , use 8 inch or 9 inch greased pie pan
instead . less crust ? experiment with preheating skillet on top of

the broiler . take one of the parts of dough and make a ball out of
it . flatten it and then roll it out on a lightly floured surface
until you have a round that is about 1/8 inch thick . when the skillet
is very hot , pick up the naan and slap it onto the heated surface .
let it cook slowly for about 4 to 5 minutes . it will either puff up
completely or partially . now put the whole skillet under the broiler
for 1 to 1 1/2 minutes or until the puffing-up process completes
itself and there are a few reddish spots on the naan . remove the naan
with a spatula and brush with butter if you like . make all of the
naans this way , keeping them stacked and covered with a clean
dishcloth . serve hot . if you wish to have the naans later , wrap them

2 oz to 3 oz castor sugar
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon baking soda

byrd 's custard . it comes in a large tin , like a container of powdered
chocolate for chocolate milk . just follow the directions to make a

oatcakes ( traditional method )

breads

4 oz oatmeal
1 teaspoon fat
1 ; water , hot
1 pinch salt
1 pinch baking soda

as the dough stiffens when lying about , it is best to make a bannock
at a time , using the above quantities , the next being prepared whilst
the one is on the girdle [ not a typo ! ] .

put the oatmeal into a bowl and add the salt and soda . melt a
teaspoon of dripping or fat ( bacon fat , goose fat , or poultry fat are
all excellent ) . make a well in the centre of the meal , put in the
dripping , and add as much hot water as will make a stiff paste . rub
plenty of oatmeal on to the baking board ; turn out the mixture and
form into a smooth ball . knead and roll out as thinly as possible .
rub constantly on both sides with dry meal to prevent sticking , and
keep the edges as even as possible by pinching wit finger and thumb .
give a final rub with meal , cut into a round , using a plate , and then
cut the bannock into farls ( fardels or quarters ) or into smaller
pieces . place on a moderately hot girdle and bake steadily till th
cakes curl up at the edge ; then toast the other side slightly before
a clea fire or finish in the oven .

if you have neither a girdle nor a thick-bottomed frying-pan , you may
bake the oatcakes in a moderate over for 20-30 minutes , till quite
dry and curle at the edges .

buttered oatcakes are particularly good with marmalade , honey ,
cheese , frie herrings , and sardines .

soda pretzels

breads , soda

: dipping solution

5 c water
1/3 c baking soda
: dough -- -- -- -- -- -- -
1 1/2 c white flour
1 1/2 c whole wheat flour
1 ts baking soda
4 tb honey
1 c buttermilk
: course/kosher salt

this recipe for pretzels uses traditional irish soda bread dought
instead of a yeast based dough . it 's quick and works great ! the
pretzels come out excellent -- like the street vendor type . i hope you
enjoy ...

combine water and soda in a non-aluminum pot ( corning works well ) .
heat to a boil or until all soda dissolves . take off heat and set
aside . this will be your dipping solution .

preheat oven to 400 deg f sift flours and soda together and mix
homogeneously . add honey and slowly add buttermilk while working with
hands until it is a firm dough . with a pin , roll dought into a flat
sheet . cut dough in long strips to make large pretzel twists , or cut
into bite sized pieces ( like i do ! ) . dip the prepared pieces of dough
completely into the dipping solution . this will create the brown
crunchy pretzel shell . once dipped , place on an oven rack ( if bite
sized pieces are being made , cover the rack with aluminum foil and
spray with pam ) . sprinkle with course salt if desired .

cook for 10 minutes of until dark brown on the second oven rack from
the bottom .

this method works great . pretzels are basically regular bread dough
dipped in a baking soda solution before baking . the advantage to this
method is that soda bread , a quick bread , has no yeast and does not
require the time needed for rising before cooking . as soon as the
dought is made , it is ready for the oven ! walt mm

improved cornbread

2 tablespoon baking powder
1 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon honey
2 tablespoon vegetable oil ( lard or crisco would ; have been better )
1 cup buttermilk
1 cup white flour
1 cup cornmeal

mix well while preheating greased pans or skillet at 400 for a few
minutes . pour in batter and bake at 400 for 20-25 minutes . could be
baked in cornbread pan or muffin tins also . i do n't really use
buttermilk by the way . it would go bad in the fridge because i bake
so seldom . i use four tsp of dried buttermilk and one cup of water .
the real thing would be better i presume . medium bread pans filled
half way will make two loafs .

skillet method would be heat oil or lard while heating the pan , then
add to the batter before pouring into the skillet . enjoy it !

i found that some recipes called for one egg , some all cornmeal flour
( which produces corn frisbees ) , some sugar instead of honey , and milk
instead of buttermilk . confused ? i was . this is my creation and i 'm
not sure the salt is necessary . it will increase about 70 % when

2 pkg active dry yeast
1/2 teaspoon sugar
1/4 cup sugar
1/4 cup milk ; lukewarm ( 110-115 deg )
2 1/2 cup all purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
2 egg
8 tablespoon butter , unsalted ; cut into
1 ; small bits
1 tablespoon butter ; softened
1 teaspoon lemon peel ; finely grated
1 egg ; hard boiled , in the
1 ; shell , dyed red with food
1 ; coloring
1 egg yolk ; lightly beaten
-- -- silver xpress mail system 5 -- --

in a small , shallow bowl , sprinkle the yeast and the 1/2 teaspoon of
sugar over the lukewarm milk . let it stand for 2 or 3 minutes , then
stir to dissolve the yeast completely . set the bowl in a warm , draft
free place ( such as an unlighted oven ) for 8 to 10 minutes , or until
the mixture doubles in volume .
combine 1 1/2 cups of flour , the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar , and
the salt in a deep mixing bowl . make a well in the center , and add
the yeast and the 2 eggs . gently stir the center ingredients together
with a large spoon , then gradually incorporate the flour and continue
beating until all the ingredients are well combined . beat in the 8
tablespoons of butter and lemon peel , add up to 1 cup more flour ,
beating it n a few tablespoons at a time and using as much as
necessary to from a dough that can be gathered into a soft and still
somewhat sticky ball . ( when the dough becomes difficult to stir
easily , work in the flour with your fingers . )
place the dough on a lightly floured surface , and knead it by
pressing it down , pushing it forward several times with the heel of
your hand , and folding it back on itself . repeat for about 10
minutes , or until the dough is smooth and elastic . sprinkle the
dough with a little extra flour from time to time to prevent it from
sticking to the board .
shape the dough into a ball and place it in a large , lightly
buttered bowl . dust the top with a little flour , drape with a
kitchen towel and set aside in a warm , draft free place for about 1
hour until the dough doubles in bulk .
with a pastry brush , coat a baking sheet with the tablespoon of
softened butter . punch the dough down with a single blow of your
fist , then transfer it to a lightly floured surface . to shape the
dough into a snail like loaf , roll it into a thick rope about 2
inches in diameter and 24 inches long . starting at one end , loop the
rope into a circle about 6 inches in diameter , and then into ever
smaller concentric circles . carefully transfer the loaf to the baking
sheet and let it rise in a warm place for about 30 minutes .
preheat the oven to 350 degrees ( f ) . press the dyed egg gently
into the center and brush the top of the loaf with the beaten egg
yolk . bake in the middle of the oven for about 45 minutes , or until

semolina bread with black sesame seeds

breads

1 teaspoon active dry yeast
1 7/8 cup water -- 105-115 degrees
1 1/4 cup basic bread sponge
3 1/2 cup durum wheat flour
1/3 cup durum wheat flour -- for
1 kneading
1/3 cup yellow cornmeal
1/4 cup black sesame seeds
4 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cornmeal -- for sprinkling

black sesame seeds may be available at health food stores or japanese
markets .

in a bowl , dissolve the yeast in the water . allow to proof for three
minutes .

stir the sponge into the water , breaking the sponge up using your
hands or a spoon .

add 3 1/2 cups of the durum flour , cornmeal , 2 tablespoons of sesame
seeds , and the salt and mix , scraping and folding until the dough
gathers into a single mass . turn the dough out onto a lightly
floured surface , and knead the dough until smooth and elastic ,
gradually adding as much of the 1/3 cup of durum aas needed ( but as
little as you can get away with ) .

shape into a ball and place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl , cover
with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight .

after removing the dough from the refrigerator , allow to sit for two
hours in a draft-free location .

sprinkle a baking sheet , without sides , generously with cornmeal .
flour a worksurface . halve the dough and flatten each half gently
into a 10x12 inch rectangle . roll each rectangle tightly along a 10
inch side , making two 12 inch cylinders . roll from the center
towards the edge to make 20 inch ropes . coil the rope from one end ,
pulling up the center knot . place the coils on the baking sheet .

mist the loaves lightly using a plant sprayer . spoon a tablespoon of
the seeds along each of the coils . cover with plastic wrap and allow
to double in a draft-free location . this should take 1 to 2 hours .

preheat the oven for at least thirty minutes along with a baking
stone or tiles on the middle rack to 425 . place a baking pan with
decent sides on the bottom shelf . boil two cups of water . pour the
boiling water into the baking pan . with a quick jerk , slide the
loaves off the sheet and onto the stone .

bake for 25 minutes until the loaves are hollow sounding when tapped
on the bottom . when done , cool on a rack .

note : durum wheat is the hardest variety of wheat and makes a very
high-gluten flour . durum is made from the same wheat as semolina ,
but is finely ground and is superior for making bread . it can be
found in health food stores , specialty food markets , and some italian
markets .

chapatis # 3

breads , indian

1 1/2 cup flour , unbleached
1/2 cup flour , whole wheat
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon ghee
1/2 cup water

mix flours , salt , and butter and add just enough water to make a firm
dough , somewhat like a biscuit dough . knead for 10-15 minutes - the
more the dough is kneaded , the lighter the bread will be . shape the
dough into a ball , cover with a sheet of plastic and let it rest for
at least 1 hour . if left to rest overnight in the refrigerator , the
finished bread will be even lighter .

when ready to bake , take a small piece of dough about the size of a
golf ball , or a bit smaller . on a lightly floured board , roll the
dough into a thin circle , about 5 inches in diameter . repeat with all
the dough .

heat a griddle or heavy-bottomed iron skillet until it is very hot
( you will notice the smoke rising from it ) . place the rolled out
chapati on the griddle and let it cook for 2-3 minutes , depending on
how thin you have rolled it . using a pair of kitchen tongs , you can
lift the chapati to see if the underside has turned a golden brown .
flip , and cook the other side about 1 minute .

as they are cooked , store the chapatis on a towel in a warm covered
container until ready to serve . serve as soon as the last chapati is
baked .

note : in india breads sometimes are baked in the fiery clay tandoor ,
where they develop brown spots and bubbles . to achieve a similar
effect at home , you can use tongs to hold each chapati over a hot gas
flame until it puffs like a little balloon . the chapati will
collapse as it cools .

italian country bread with biga

breads , ethnic

1 biga :
1 teaspoon yeast
1 1/8 cup warm water
2 cup bread flour
1 dough :
1 biga ( above )
1 1/4 cup bread flour
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1/4 cup water

biga is a starter , almost similar to sourdough but not quite.the
bread has a flavorful , yeasty beery quality . so 10 to 12 hours before
you want the bread , mix the 1 tsp . yeast in the water and let it
bubble and foam . mix in the flour gradually to make a soft almost
soupy dough . cover and it will rise and triple in volume and then
fall back and re-rise during the 6 to 8 hours you let it be . then
make the bread . stir the salt right into the biga mixture , mix in the
additional water ( cold or cool not warm ) until it is a thin soupy
quality . mix in the flour to make a firm but soft dough which leaves
the sides of the bowl . turn out to a floured surface and knead dough ,
adding additional flour if necessary to make a smooth dry dough .
place dough in a bowl , greased with olive oil , cover and let rise
doubled about 2 hours . punch dough down and knead it into a flat
oval . cut in half and form each half into a baguette and let them
rest covered with a towel for 30 minutes . then stretch them into
longer baguette shapes and place them in a baguette baking tray if
you have it . let rest for 20 minutes . then slash tops and place into
a preheated 450 oven for 20 minutes or done . if you do n't have a
baguette tray any baking sheet or baking stone will do . you also
could shape the breads in one large round loaf instead of 2
baguettes . bake the one large loaf 10 to 15 minutes longer . note :
since this bread is fat free eat the same day or freeze as it stales
quickly .

sourdough bread ( bob 's )

breads

6 cup flour ( all-purpose or bread )

1 tablespoon bran
1 pkg yeast ( 1 tbsp )
2 cup sourdough starter
2 3/4 cup warm ( 105-115 f ) water
1 tablespoon malt extract , powdered & unflavored
2 teaspoon salt

make a yeast sponge by mixing the starter with 1 cup warm water and 1
1/4 cups flour . cover the bowl with a towel and place in a warm spot
for 24 hours . at that time , stir down the sponge and put 1/2 of it
back into a jar and store in the fridge for your next baking .

to make the bread : mix the yeast with 1 1/2 cups of warm water and
allow to proof for 10 minutes . ( note : i sometimes use a mixture of
beer and water to proof the yeast in , as it adds to the flavor of the
bread . ) add the yeast mixture to the sponge , add the buckwheat flour ,
bran , malt extract , and salt . mix well , then add the flour a cup at a
time to form a soft dough . ( note : the 6 cups includes the 1 1/4 cups
used in the sponge , so you will be adding 4 1/2 to 5 cups to make the
dough ) after adding 3-4 cups , turn the dough out on a floured surface
and knead for 12 minutes adding the rest of the flour as the dough
gets sticky . the dough should be soft and elastic , add only enough
flour to get to this point where the dough is no longer sticky .
( note : malt extract can be found at stores selling home-brewing and
wine making supplies as well as some health food stores . )

place the dough in an oiled bowl and turn to coat ; let rise in a warm
spot until doubled in bulk . punch down the dough , remove from the
bowl and knead for a couple of minutes . let the dough rest for 5-10
minutes , then cut in half and shape into 2 oval loaves .

cover the loaves with a towel and let rise until doubled or more ( 1-2
hours ) . allow the dough to rise in a cool spot for several hours to
develop more of the sourdough flavor .

bake the bread in a preheated 400 f oven for 15 minutes , then lower
the heat to 350 f for the next 15-20 minutes . then reduce the oven to
325 f for the final 15-25 minutes until the loaves are done . this
lowering of the heat attempts to duplicate the falling heat in a
baker 's wood fired oven . test the loaves for doneness by rapping on
the bottoms , it is done when it sounds hollow . cool on a rack before
storing ( if it lasts long enough to store ! )

processor . ) cover and set aside for 15 minutes or so . on a floured
surface , roll out a third of the dough , into a rectangle 1/8th inch
thick . turn the dough and roll from the center , so that all the dough
in the rectangle is even in thickness . run a hand under the dough to
loosen it . dust with flour and flip over and dust with flour . with a
sharp knife , cut into 1 1/2-inch squares . place a teaspoon of
mushroom filling ( see the next recipe in this series ) in each square ,
being careful not to smear the edges . fold on the diagonal to make a
triangle . pinch together the two bottom corners , wrapping it around
your thumb with the point up ( to resemble small ears on a cat ) ,
making sure that the edges have bonded or the stuffing will boil out .

flour . repeat with the other pieces of dough , saving the scraps for
last as the dough gets a little tougher when worked . drop 10 or 12
vushka into 6 to 8 cups of rapidly boiling water and stir once with a

orange cranberry muffins

breads , breakfast , bbs

1 orange ( i use a large navel
1 _orange with thick rind )
3/4 cup dried cranberries
1 egg
3/4 cup milk
2/3 cup vegetable oil
1 1/2 cup flour
2 1/2 tablespoon flour
1 cup sugar
2 tablespoon sugar
1 1/8 teaspoon baking powder
3/4 teaspoon salt

the night before : grate the orange rind . squeeze the juice from the
orange . mix the rind , juice , and cranberries in a bowl and
refrigerate overnight .

the next day : preheat oven to 400 degrees . mix the egg , milk and
vegetable oil in a small bowl . sift together the flour , sugar , baking
powder , and salt in a large bowl . add the cranberries ( with the juice
and rind ) to the flour mixture . add the liquid mixture to the dry
mixture . the batter will be runnier than most muffin batters -- but
that 's the way it should be . fill 12 greased muffin cups ( or use foil
baking cups to line the muffin cups ) with the batter and bake for
25 minutes .

these muffins are very moist and tasty . the rather strange
measurements of flour and sugar are the result of my reducing the end
result from 4 dozen muffins to
1 dozen .

piadini

breads , italian

3 cup all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
3 tablespoon oliye oil
1/2 cup ( generous ) mixture of half milk , ha ; lf water

i 'm not much of a baker , but these recipes for an italian bread and
sauteed greens to stuff in it sounded good ...

mix flour , salt and baking powder in a large bowl . make a well in the
center and pour in the olive oil and a little of the milk-water
mixture . start to mix the dough with a fork , gradually adding the
rest of the liquid ; you probably will need extra water , depending on
the absorbency of the flour .

when the dough has come together and leaves the sides of the bowl
clean , form it into a rough ball and put it on a very lightly floured
surface . knead until it is smooth , about 10 minutes . let rest for 10
to 30 minutes , at your convenience .

when the dough has rested divide it into small balls , each about the
size of a plum . roll each ball out into a flat circle about 1/8-inch
thick . now put the heavy pan or bakestone on medium heat . let the pan
become hot enough to make a drop of water dance .

put the first piadina in the pan and press down with a wooden
spatula . let cook on one side for 20 seconds or so++when you lift it
to turn it over it should have whitened , and there will be the faint
beginnings of small brown scorch marks . repeat with the second side
and turn the bread 2 or 3 , times during cooking .

when the bread is ready it will have puffed up like a pocket bread and
should have small brown spots over its surface ; as soon as you have
achieved this effect , put the cooked piadina on a wire cake rack and
proceed with the next one .

serve hot , with slices of prosciutto , salami or cheese , and perhaps
olives , radishes or a little tomato for a quick lunch .

peach leaf starter

breads

1 quart fresh peach leaves , unpacked
3 cup water
3 baked potatoes , medium size
1/2 cup yellow corn meal
3 tablespoon sugar
2 teaspoon salt

bring water to rolling boil and steep peach leaves in it for 15
minutes . drain liquid and add enough water to make 3 full cups again .
this will have a rather unappetizing green color but do n't worry ! it
will disappear during the fermentation process . peel hot baked
potatoes and put through food mill or sieve . scald 1/2 cup corn meal
in 1 cup of the liquid until it reaches boiling point and thickens .
stir constantly so that it will not become lumpy . now combine all
ingredients in large mixing bowl ( do not use metal or plastic ) .
cover with cheesecloth and set in a warm place ( 80-85 ) until well
fermented . in warm humid weather this will take about 24 hours . in
cool dry weather a few more hours may be required for mixture to
become active . stir every few hours . when it is ready , pour into a
large glass jar . store in refrigerator at about 38 degrees . if
necessary stir down a time or two until it stops foaming . it is ready
for use when about 1/2 inch of clear liquid has risen to the top .
this will take about 2 days . stir well before using .

when this starter has been used down to about 1 cupful , add 3 cups
water , 3 medium sized baked potatoes , 1/2 cup corn meal scalded in 1
cup of the water , 3 tbsp . sugar and 2 tsp . salt prepared as for the
first time ( peach leaves are not needed ) . set in warm place until it
becomes very active in about 6 to 8 hours . store in refrigerator and
it will be ready for use the next day . a properly renewed starter
improves with age and , once one becomes accustomed to taking care of
it , it all becomes automatic . when , for some reason , it can not be
used about twice a week , stir it thoroughly every few days and add 1
tsp . sugar . scald jar and lid before filling each time .

pampushky ( raised doughnuts with filling )

breads , christmas , russian

2 tablespoon sugar
1/2 cup ; water
2 pkg active dry yeast
1/4 cup milk
5 cup unbleached all-purpose flour ; up to 6 may be needed
1/4 lb butter ; 1 stick
1/2 cup sugar
2 large eggs
3 large egg yolks
1 teaspoon salt ; if using sweet butter
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 zest of one lemon
1 cup rose preserve or any dry fruit pres ; erve
1 powdered sugar ; as needed

combine the sugar and water , sprinkle with the yeast , and let stand
until soft . heat the milk to lukewarm , and add the milk and 1/4 cup
of the flour to the yeast mixture . beat well , cover and allow to rise
until light and bubbly , about 10 minutes . in another bowl , cream the
butter and sugar . beat eggs and egg yolks together , blending well and
combine with the sugar-butter mixture , beating thoroughly until the
eggs are pale white . grate a lemon on a fine grater until all of the
yellow color is grated off and add this ( the zest ) , vanilla , and the
yeast mixture to the butter-egg mixture . mix in 4 cups of flour . if
the dough seems a little loose , add a little more , but the dough
should be soft . knead , by hand , for about 10 minutes . replace in a
greased bowl , turning once to grease the top , and cover with a damp
towel , set in a warm place until double in bulk . punch down , knead a
few more times , and allow to rise again until the dough is doubled .
when doubled , divide the dough into 4 parts . on a lightly floured
surface , roll one part into a rectangle about 1/4-inch thick , turning
once or twice during the rolling to achieve a uniform thickness . dust
with flour sparingly . place 1 ts of rose preserve at evenly space
intervals on the dough , or with a 2 1/2-inch cutter , gently form
impressions and place the filling in each . roll another portion out ,
as above , to the same thickness , and gently cover the first ,
overlapping a little . ( filling will show through . ) cut circles with
the cutter . place them on a lightly floured cookie sheet and allow
rise until double in size . repeat until all of the dough is used ,
rolling out the scraps last . heat oil or shortening to 375 degrees f .
in a deep fryer or wide skillet . test the temperature by frying a
piece of bread ; it should bubble and turn golden quickly . the fat
should not be smoking . fry 5 or 6 pampushky at a time . do not crowd
as this lowers the temperature and the doughnuts will absorb too much
grease . when one side is golden , flip with a spoon to fry the other
side . dough will puff up in the frying . perfect pampushky are light
as air . drain on paper towels . when slightly cooled , sprinkle with
powdered sugar .

serve with tea .

1 alfalfa sprouts
1 radish sprouts
1 slice very ripe tomato
1 olive oil
1 wine vinegar
1 fresh ground black pepper

here 's one i invented a lot of years ago for a
vegetarian friend . not low fat , but it is good ( what
can i say , i 'm originally from california ) .

lay the bread slices on a flat surface . put half the
avocado slices on each bread half . top one bread half
with the remaining ingredients , dressing this mess
very lightly with oil and vinegar . top with remaining
avocado/bread half , and cut into quarters to serve .

for a non-vegetarian version of this , i 've added thin
slices of smoked turkey .

i 've also made this by piling the whole mess into
halves of pita bread , but if you can get good
whole-grain bread , that 's even better .

spoon . turn the dough onto a well floured work surface . knead
rhythmically for 10 to 15 minutes , until the dough is smooth ,
springy , nonsticky , and elastic . add more flour as you knead if
necessary . the dough is ready if you can poke to fingers into it and
the resulting indentations spring back . cover the dough with a cloth
and let rest while you wash , dry and generously butter the bowl .
knead the dough a few more turns , then form it into a ball and place
it in the bowl . turn it to coat with butter . cover the bowl and put
it in a warm , draft-free place until the dough has doubled in bulk ,
about 1 1/2 hours . it has risen sufficiently when you can gently
poke a finger into the dough and the hole reamins . ( do n't poke too
enthusiastically or the dough will collapse . ) when doubled , flour
your fist and punch the dough down . knead it a few times and then
let it rest . sprinkle 1 large or 2 small baking sheets with a liberal
amount of cornmeal . divide the dough into 3 equal parts . while you
work with 1 piece , keep the other 2 covered . flour your work
surface . with a rolling pin , roll each piece of dough into a
rectangle approximately 14-inches long x 7-inches wide . spread it
with softened garlic butter . roll the long edge toward the opposite
long edge , as if you were rolling up a rug . pinch ends closed . place
loves on the baking sheets . with a sharp knife or razor blade , slash
the loves lightly at 2-inch intervals . cover with a cloth and place
in a warm draft-free place to rise until doubled , about 1/2 hour .
meanwhile preheat oven to 400 degrees f. bake for 35 to 40 minutes
with a pan of boiling water on the oven floor . spray loaves with
water several times during the baking process . ( this helps the bread
form a thick crusty shell . ) to test for doneness , rap the loaf with
your knuckles . the loaf should sound hollow . cool on wire racks ,
but the loaves are delicious eaten warm right out of the oven .

1 cup oil
1 1/2 cup walnuts or pecans
1/2 teaspoon baking powder
2 cup flour

mix sugar and eggs in mix master . add the oil . remove from the mixer
and proced by hand . add [ finely chopped ] nuts into the mixture and
add the other ingredients into the mixture with a wooden spoon .
mixture must not be too soft not too stiff so you can roll it into a
salami shape .

place rolls on a cookie sheet in a 350 [ f ] oven until golden brown .
remove from the oven and cut into diagonal slices . return to oven for
about 15-20 minutes .

i find that i have to chill it over night and add flour to each roll
so it will stand up as a roll and not flatten out-sometimes as much
as a cup or even more depending on the size of the eggs . submitted by

classical puff pastry

breads , baker

1 3 1/2 c all-purpose flour
1 1 1/2 ts salt
1 lb unsalted butter , cold
1 1/4 cup ice water

combine the flour and salt in the bowl of a food processor and
process few seconds to combine . cut 2 ounces ( 4 tablespoons ) of the
butter into small pieces and process with the flour until there are
no lumps and the mixture is the texture of cornmeal .

pour half the ice water in a large bowl and turn the flour mixture
onto it . sprinkle the remaining water over it , reserving one
tablespoon . transfer the mixture to a large mixing bowl , drizzle the
ice water evenly over it and toss like a salad until the dough comes
together in a ragged mass . add the remaining water if necessary .
cover in plastic wrap and chill .

meanwhile , place the remaining butter between layers of plastic wrap
and pound with a rolling pin to make malleable . place it between two
sheets of plastic wrap and , using your hands or a rolling pin , shape
it into a 6-inch square .

remove the dough from the fridge , lightly flour the work surface and ,
using either your hands or a rolling pin , shape the mass into 12-inch
square . place the butter on the dough catty-corner and fold the edges
of the dough into the center to enclose it .

lightly flour the surface of the dough and roll it into a rectangle
measuring about 12 inches high x 26 inches wide . if the dough sticks ,
loosen it underneath with a long flexible metal palette knife and
scrape off any butter sticking to the work surface . brush off any
excess flour . fold the dough into thirds and turn it 90 degrees , so
that seams are parallel to the table 's edge . this is called a
`` turn '' . lightly flour and roll it out again to about 12 x 26 inches .
brush off the excess flour and again fold it into thirds . place the
dough on a sheet tray , cover it with a plastic bag and refrigerate
for 20 to 30 minutes .

repeat this , giving the dough two more turns , each time rolling it
out to 12 x 26 inches . refrigerate for another 20 or 30 minutes ,
then give the dough 2 final turns . there are six turns in all .

lightly roll it to flatten and even it . wrap it in plastic wrap or a
bag and chill for at least two hours before using it . it can be kept ,
refrigerated , for up to 3 days , or frozen for up to 3 months .

yield : 2- 3/4 pounds of dough

to roll pastry : ( for home size 11 x 17-inch sheet trays )

for thinly rolled dough ( 1/16-inch ) used to make little pizzas start
with 15 ounces ( 1/3 of the recipe ) . for thickly rolled dough
( 3/8-inch ) used for everything else , start with 22 ounces ( 1/2
recipe ) .

line an 11 x 17-inch sheet tray with parchment paper . on a floured
table , roll the rectangle of dough to a length of 15 inches and a
width of 10 inches . dust off any excess flour . roll the dough up
onto the rolling pin and transfer it to the sheet tray . using a
10-inch rolling pin and rolling gently from the center out , roll the
dough to fit the tray . make sure it is even - with no lumpy edges .
rolling lightly and gently enables you to keep it even .

shapes to cut out of the 3/8-inch thick dough :

bouchee : cut 2 ( 3-1/2-inch ) rounds of dough . cut a 2-1/4-inch
circle out of the second round . egg wash the first round . place the
ring from the second round over the first so that the edges line up .
dock the edges and center with a fork . thin inner circle can be
baked as well and used for a lid .

bouchee made from special cutter : use and cutter made especially for
this purpose . it has two cutting edges - one inside and shorter than
the other that scores , rather than cuts the dough .

criss-cross tartlet : cut a 5-inch square . fold it into a triangle
and cut from each edge towards the apex , stopping about 1/2-inch
short of the apex . the cut should be about 1/2-inch from the edge .
open it up to the square and place on a cookie sheet . egg wash the
edges . bring one point over to the opposite corner of the inner
square and press . bring the opposite point over and press . press
along the rim to seal . dock rim and center .

puff strip : from a sheet tray of frozen dough , cut a rectangular
piece 8 '' wide and the length of the sheet tray . transfer it to a
paper lined cookie sheet . using a pizza wheel , cut a 3/4 '' strip from
each edge . egg wash the edges of the center piece and flip the cut
strips onto the egg washed edge . dock the 2 rims with a fork , then
dock down the center .

vol-au-vent : similar to above , but round . press whatever size round
you want into the dough on the sheet tray . lift and cut along the
circular impression with a pizza wheel . center another round , and
inch or so smaller in diameter than the first over the circle of
dough and press lightly . remove and cut along this line . egg was
the edge , as above , and cut through the outer rim in one place . place
the rim over the center circle , lining up the edges . dock the rim
with a fork , then dock the center . bake 20 to 25 minutes in a
preheated 425 degree f. oven .

joululimppa ( finnish holiday rye bread )

breads , ethnic

2 cup buttermilk
1/2 cup molasses
1/4 cup butter or margarine
2 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon fennel seeds
1 teaspoon caraway seeds
2 tablespoon dry yeast
1/2 cup warm water
1 grated rind of 1 orange
1 cup rye flakes or wheat germ
2 cup dark or light rye flour
3 1/2 to 4 1/2 cups uncleached white or w ; hole wheat flour
1 glaze :
1 tablespoon molasses
2 tablespoon water

similar to swedish rye . can be toasted .

heat the buttermilk , molasses , butter or margarine , salt , fennel
seeds , and caraway seeds until the butter melts . set aside to cool .

dissolve the yeast in the warm water . let it stand for 5 minutes
until the yeast bubbles . ( ( my comment : whisk in some flour and
molasses to nourish the yeast . ) ) add the yeast to the cooled
buttermilk mixture along with the grated orange rind , rye flakes or
wheat germ , and rye flour . beat well until smooth . add 3 to 3 1/2
cups of wheat flour , stirring in a cup at a time , until the dough
will not readily absorb more flour . the dough will be rough .

flour a work surface with the remaining wheat flour and turn the
dough out onto it . cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest
for 15 minutes . ( the gluten in rye is more fragile than in wheat . it
needs a resting time to recuperate and reform and does not require as
vigorous or lengthy a kneading ) .

gently knead the dough for 5 to 10 minutes until smooth . form the
dough into a ball and place it in a large buttered bowl or pot ,
turning it to coat all sides with butter . cover it and let it rise ,
in a warm spot , until doubled in size , about an hour .

punch down the dough and gently knead it for one minute . form the
dough into three round loaves and place in lightly buttered 9-inch
cake pans or on buttered baking sheets . cover and let rise until
almost doubled in size , 45 minutes to an hour .

preheat the oven to 375 degrees . combine the water and molasses ,
brush the tops with half of this mixture to glaze . then lightly
pierce the loaves all over with a fork .

bake for 35 to 45 minutes , until the bread sopunds hollow when tapped
on the bottom . while the bread is hot , brush it with the remaining
glaze . remove the loaves from the pans and cool on racks .

yields 3 loaves .

piney woods hush puppies

1 teaspoon soda
1 teaspoon salt
2 tablespoon granulated sugar
2 tablespoon all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon baking powder
1 egg , beaten
2 cup buttermilk
1 1/2 cup cooking oil ( about )

mix all dry ingredients ; beat milk and egg together and combine with
dry ingredients ; batter should hold its shape when picked up in
spoon . if it is too soft , add more cornmeal . drop by molded
tablespoon into 350 '' f fat and cook about 1 1/2 minutes ; turn and cook
on second side 1 minute . allow oil to heat a few seconds after
removing a batch . delicious freshly cooked and hot ; however , leftover
hush puppies freeze well . when ready to serve frozen hush puppies ,
place on oven rack in preheated 250 '' f until very hot and crisp . makes
about 48 hush puppies 2 '' round . hints on frying : using a small
diameter heavy saucepan allows using a minimum oil ; a 5 or 6 inch pan
with oil 1 1/2 inches deep and heated to 350 '' f will cook three hush
puppies in about 2 1/2 minutes . when batter consistency is correct
and oil is at 350 '' f , hush puppies will become firm , round shapes
almost as soon as they enter the hot oil . if they are cooked in oil
that is too hot , they will not cook in the center . serving
suggestions : especially good served with fried catfish , trout ,
shrimp , oysters , chicken or chicken-fried steak . source : texas

flour tortillas ( making )

breads

2 cup unbleached all-purpose
1 flour
1 teaspoon salt
3/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/3 cup vegetable shortening
2/3 to 3/4 cup very hot water

since tortillas freeze well , you can make a batch on a leisurely day
and have a supply on hand . mix the flour with the salt and baking
powder . using your hands , mix in the shortening until the mixture
becomes a coarse , even meal . mix in 2/3 cup of the water , adding it
all at once , and knead for 2 minutes , or until the dough has the
consistency of a stiff bread dough . if dry and crumbly , add extra
water ; if too moist , add a few tablespoons of additional flour . cover
the dough and allow it to rest for 20 minutes .

heat a skillet , saute pan , or griddle over medium-high heat until hot
enough that a drop of water immediately sizzles and evaporates .

you will be rolling and then cooking each tortilla , rather than
rolling them all and then cooking them . pinch off a piece of dough
the size of a golfball and dust your hands and the dough ball with
flour . place the ball on a floured surface and flatten the ball with
your hands into a circle 1/2 inch thick . then , using a rolling pin ,
roll it twice in the same direction and form a circle 1/8 inch thick
and about 8 to 9 inches in diameter . immediately place it in the hot
skillet and cook it for 30 to 45 seconds , or until bubbles begin to
form on the top . if the tortilla puffs up into a pillow , push it down
with a spatula . turn and cook 20 seconds , remove with a spatula , and
keep warm by placing it in a tea towel and covering it with the
towel . roll and cook remaining dough the same way .

to soften flour tortillas : flour tortillas , like corn tortillas ,
become brittle when cold , and must be softened to become pliable for
bending into quesadillas or rolling for chimichangas . to soften , heat
a dry skillet , saute pan , or griddle over medium heat . heat a
tortilla for about 30 seconds , or until bubbles start to appear on
top . turn and heat the second side for about 15 seconds . fold or roll
immediately .

muffins & crumpets ( mrs. beeton 's )

breads

1 quart water
2 oz yeast
1/2 lb potatoes
1/2 oz salt

makes 24 muffins or crumpets

flour

muffins : wash , peel and boil the potatoes , rub through a colander ,
add the water ( just warm enough to bear the hand in it without
discomfort ) ; then dissolve the yeast and salt in it , and stir in
sufficient flour to make a moist paste . beat it well in a deep bowl
and then clear off the paste from the hands ; cover over with a clean
cloth and leave it to rise in a warm place . when it has well risen ,
and is light and spongy , turn it out on the table , dredge over with
flour , and then divide it off into pieces about 3 oz in weight , roll
them up into round shapes , and set them on a wooden tray , well dusted
with flour to prove . when light enough , see that the hot plate is
hot , and then carefully transfer the muffins from the tray , one at a
time , using a thin tin slice for the purpose , taking particular care
not to knock out the proof or the muffins will be spoilt . when they
have been properly cooked on one side , turn over with the slice and
cook the other side . when the muffins are done , brush off the flour ,
and lay them on a clean cloth or sieve to cool .

to toast them , divide the edge of the muffin all round by pulling it
open to the depth of about 1 inch with the fingers . put it on a
toasting fork and hold it before a clear fire till one side is nicely
browned , but not burnt ; turn , and toast it on the other . do not toast
them too quickly , otherwise the middle of the muffin will not be
warmed through . when done , divide them by pulling them open ; butter
them slighlty on both sides , put them together again , and cut them
into halves . pile on a hot dish and send quickly to table .

time : 25 to 30 minutes to bake . sufficient for about 2 dozen muffins .

crumpets : proceed exactly the same as directed for muffins ( above ) ,
but stir in only half the quantity of flour used for them , so that
the mixture is more of a batter than a sponge . cover over , and leave
for 1/2 an hour . at the end of that time take a large wooden spoon
and well beat up the batter , leave in the spoon , cover over , and
leave for another 1/2 an hour . then give the batter another good beat
up . this process must be repeated 3 times with the intervals . when
completed , see that the hot plate is quite hot , lay out some crumpet
rings rubbed over inside with a little clean lard on a baking tin ,
and pour in sufficient of the batter to make the crumpets . when
cooked on one side , turn over with a palette-knife , and when done
take off on to a clean cloth to cool . muffins and crumpets should
always be served on separate dishes , and both toasted and served as
quickly as possible .

time : about 20 minutes to cook . sufficient for about 2 dozen .

1 teaspoon baking soda
2/3 cup canned or mashed cooked pumpkin

1/2 cup buttermilk , or a bit more if needed
1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon grated nutmeg

sugar

`` a batch of these intriguingly flavored biscuits is a nice addition
to any meal . this particular biscuit has a tendency to overbrown on
the bottom , so use a light-colored metal baking sheet instead of a
nonstick sheet . serve the biscuits hot with butter . ''

preheat oven to 450 f. sift together the flour , sugar , baking powder
and soda , salt , and spices into a large bowl . cut in the butter ( or
use food processor ) until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs . add
the nuts . in a small bowl , whisk together the pumpkin and buttermilk .
add it to the flour mixture and stir to combine . the dough will be
quite stiff and not all the flour will be incorporated . turn the
dough out onto a lightly floured cloth and knead gently a few times
to work in the rest of the flour . roll out the dough to a 1/2 inch
thickness and cut with a 2 inch round cutter . transfer the biscuits
to a lightly oiled shiny baking sheet , and sprinkle tops with sugar .
bake for 10 minutes -- do not let them get too brown . serve immediately
with butter . if you must have jelly with the , choose a delicate
apple jelly so the subtle pumpkin flavor is not masked .

whole wheat bread w/eggs

breads

6 cup whole wheat bread flour
1 tablespoon salt
2 teaspoon dry yeast ( 1/4 oz )
1/2 cup water , warm
1/4 cup canola oil
3 tablespoon honey
4 large eggs , plus water to make
1 2 3/4 cups
1 large egg , for glazing

: stir the flour and salt together in a bowl and make a well in
the center .
: dissolve the yeast in the warm water and set aside to proof
while you mix the other liquids .
: break the 4 eggs into a measuring cup and add enough water to
make 2 3/4 cups of liquid . add the oil and honey and beat until
smooth . add this mixture and the yeast mixture to the well in the
flour and stir together .
: knead the dough until it is silky and supple . the dough
should be soft , but nor flabby . for the very best and highest bread ,
an efficient kneader will require about 20 minutes to develop the
dough to its springiest .
: form the dough into a ball and place it smooth side up in a
bowl ; cover and keep in a warm , draft-free place . after about an hour
and a half , gently poke the center of the dough about 1/2 inch deep
with your finger . if the hole does n't fill in at all , it is ready for
the next step .
: press flat , form into a smooth round , and let the dough rise
once more as before . the second rising will take half as much time as
the first .
: keep your eye on the dough , and do n't let it go so long that
it sighs when you poke it . egg-rich doughs like this benefit from a
slightly shorter rising time .
: after the second rise is done , shape your dough into 3 loaves
and place in your prepared pans . allow them to rise again until
almost doubled in size . brush the loaves with an egg wash made of one
egg plus 2 tablespoons of water . cover the whole exposed surface
carefully , but do n't let the egg wash collect in the valleys . now is
the time to sprinkle the loaves with sesame or poppy seeds if you
like .
: bake in a preheated 350 degree oven for about 45 minutes .
brush the baked loaves with melted margarine or butter while still in
pans and allow to cool in pans for 3-5 minutes . then cool on racks .

molasses and salt . let it cool for about 10 minutes and add the sour
cream , beating with a wire whisk to mix it all thoroughly . pour it
into a large bowl . when the liquid is cool enough so that a drop on
the inside of your wrist is not hot enough to hurt , add the yeast .

mix it well with the liquid , breaking up lumps as you mix . add
raisins and walnuts . add flour , 1 cup at a time , until the dough is
no longer very sticky ; it should be right when you have added about

or countertop . dump the dough onto the floury place and scrape out
the bowl onto the dough . wash , dry and grease the bowl . now , knead
the dough for about 15 to 20 minutes using up the last of the flour .
it should feel stretchy and elastic . put the dough into the greased
bowl and grease the top . cover it will a damp cloth and set it in a
warm place to rise . it may take as much as 2 hours until it is double
in bulk . when it has doubled in bulk , flour a place on the counter ,
dump it out and knead it again for about 5 minutes . divide the dough
into 4 equal parts and grease 4 bread pans . shape the dough into
loaves and put 1 in each pan . cover the pans with a damp cloth and
let the dough rise until about double in bulk , about 1 hour . preheat
the oven to 325 degrees , brush the tops of the loaves with beaten
egg , and put them in the oven . bake at 325 for 30 minutes and then at
300 degrees for another 30 minutes . the loaves will sound `` hollow ''
when tapped when they are done . take them out of the oven as soon as
they are done . turn them out of the pan onto cake racks . the bread is
best served warm , but it may be cooled and then frozen to save .

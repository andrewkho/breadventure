challah french toast

breads, breakfast, french

6  eggs
1/2 cup heavy cream, half-and-half or milk
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 tablespoon to 6 t clarified butter
8 slice challah, cut 1-inch thick

beat the eggs together with cream, half-and-half, or milk. beat in
cinnamon and salt. melt the butter in a large frying pan. dip the
challah slices, one at a time, into the egg mixture, making sure that
each slice is well coated. the challah should absorb a little of the
egg mixture but not enough to get soggy. fry each battered challah
slice for 2-3 minutes on each side until they are golden brown. don't
fry too fast or the inside will be wet and gooey. serve with your
favorite jam, maple syrup, honey, cinnamon, sugar, or plain. note:
heavy cream really is the best liquid to use in this recipe.

3 cup unbleached flour
1 cup whole wheat flour
1/2 cup nonfat milk powder
1 1/4 cup warm water (85 deg for
1  regular yeast, 100 deg for
1  rapid rise)
1 tablespoon molasses
1 pkg yeast
1 teaspoon coarse salt or 3/4 tsp table
1  salt
1/4 teaspoon ascorbic acid crystals (such
1  as fruit fresh or
1  everfresh)
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1  egg white

proof yeast in 1/2 c of warm water with molasses.  add yeast mixture
to 2 cups of unbleached flour along with 1/2 c more of the warm
water. mix, either by hand or with an electric mixer, until the
gluten is well developed, about two min.  mix remaining 1/4 c water
with last four ingredients and add to first mixture along with the
whole wheat flour and dry milk.  mix until well combined (this can
also be done by hand or with an electric mixer).  turn out on a well
floured board and knead, adding additional flour as necessary, until
you have a slightly sticky, satiny dough.  form dough into a ball and
place in an oiled bowl to rise until doubled in bulk.  punch dough
down and form into a loaf and place in an oiled 5x9 bread pan.  cover
with a towel and allow to rise until doubled in bulk (the dough will
rise well above the top of the pan). place loaf into a preheated 425
deg. oven and bake for 10 min. reduce oven temp to 350 deg and bake
an additional 25 min. allow to cool before slicing.

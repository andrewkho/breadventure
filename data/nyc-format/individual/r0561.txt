cinnamon toast bread

breads, breakfast

      ----dough----
1 pkg dry yeast
1 pinch sugar
1 1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon oil
2 cup white flour
2 cup whole-wheat flour
1 teaspoon sea salt
      ----filling----
2 tablespoon dark brown sugar
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1 tablespoon unsalted butter

in a large measuring cup, proof the yeast and sugar in the warm
water for about 5 to 10 minutes.  stir in the oil.  blend the flours
and salt together in a large bowl.  make a well in the center.  pour
in the liquid and mix until the dough comes together.  knead until
elastic, about 10 to 15 minutes by hand, or 5 minutes with a mixer
with a doughhook.
roll into a 9-15 inch rectangle and let rest for 5 minutes.
grease a 9-inch loaf pan.  blend the filling ingredients together and
spread evenly over the entire surface of the rectangle.  roll up like
a jelly roll, starting at one of the short ends.
tuck in the ends and place, seam-side down, in the loaf pan.  let
stand in a warm place till it is doubled in bulk, about 30 to 45
minutes. preheat the oven to 400 degrees.
bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or till the bread sounds hollow when
turned out of the pan and thumped on the underside.  let it cool
before slicing, if you can stand it.

early-bird buttermilk pancakes

breads, breakfast

1 1/2 cup flour
1 tablespoon sugar
1/2 teaspoon salt
2 1/4 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 cup buttermilk
2/3 cup milk
1  egg; beaten
2 tablespoon cooking oil
1  oil for pan
1/2 cup milk; as needed for thinning

sift together the flour, sugar, salt and baking powder. beat together
the buttermilk, milk, beaten egg and oil. pour the liquid into the dry
ingredients and stir until well mixed. a few small lumps in the
mixture will cook out. the first pancake is a test pancake. the
batter should be thin for pancakes, so thin the batter if necessary
with milk (not buttermilk). the pan should be lightly oiled and hot
enough to make a sprinkling of water dance, not just sit and sizzle.
ladle about 1/8 cup of the batter into the hot pan. when the top of
the pancake is full of bubbles and the bottom is golden, turn the
pancake. cook on the second side until done.

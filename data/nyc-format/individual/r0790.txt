1/2 lb stong white bread flour
1 teaspoon easy-blend yeast
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon sugar
1 oz butter; melted
1/4 pint milk; warmed

1  icing sugar
1  clotted cream

using a food-processor, a food mixer with a dough hook, or your
hands, mix the dry ingredients, add the warm milk and melted butter
and mix and knead to a smooth elastic dough. cover with lightly oiled
polythene and leave to rise until doubled in size - about 1 hour in a
warm place.

knock back and knead again briefly.  divide the dough into eight
and shape into small round buns. space them well apart on a greased
baking tray.  cover and set aside to prove (rise) until light and
puffy - about 20 minutes.

bake at 425 f (220 c) gas mark 7 for 15-20 minutes until golden
brown. cool, then cut each bun down the middle, from top to bottom
but not all the way through. split open and fill with cream and jam.
be generous, allowing plenty of jam and no less than 1 oz clotted
cream per bun. then dust with icing sugar. makes 8 buns.

biscotti di pratto

breads, italian

1/4 cup almonds, blanched
3/4 cup almonds, whole unblanched
4  eggs, divided
1 teaspoon vanilla
1/4 teaspoon almond extract
2 1/4 cup flour
1 cup sugar, white
1 teaspoon baking soda
1 pinch salt

preheat oven to 350 degrees. on a baking sheet, roast blanched and
unblanched almonds until blanched almonds start to brown, shaking pan
occasionally; 5 to 8 minutes. remove blanched almonds, place in
blender container and grind until it turns to powder. set aside.
meanwhile, return whole almonds to oven 2 to 3 minutes longer. remove
and chop whole almonds roughly with knife, leaving large chunks. set
aside. turn oven down to 300 degrees. grease baking sheet & dust with
flour; set aside. in a small bowl, beat 3 eggs, vanilla & extract. in
large bowl, mix together flour, sugar, baking soda, salt and ground
almonds. make a well in the center and add the eggs, blending to
gradually incor- porate all of flour mixture. you should have a stiff
dough. if it is too stiff to hold together, add a little water.  add
the crushed almonds and knead them evenly into the dough. divide
dough into 3 portions. form each into a long log, rounded or slightly
oval (about 1 1/2 inches in dia- meter). it will flatten as it bakes.
place on prepared baking sheet. bake 45 - 50 minutes. remove from
oven and let rest 5 minutes. turn oven down to 275 degrees. with a
serrated knife, cut logs into 3/4" slices. (note: unlike slicing a
loaf of bread, straight across its width, cut biscotti on a 45 degree
angle.) lay slices flat on 2 baking sheets. return to oven for 20 -
25 minutes, turning slices 1/2 way through baking time. remove from
oven; allow to cool completely before sealing in containers. they
will stay fresh up to 1 month.

1.  in northern ireland and in the republic, brack is the celtic
word for salt and is used to mean "bread". barm brack is leavened
bread, the word barm meaning yeast.

2.  the term "barmbrack" for an irish fruit loaf or cake does not
derive from barm or leaven.  it is a corruption of the irish word
"aran breac" (speckled bread).

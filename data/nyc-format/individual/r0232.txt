blintzas

breads, cheese/eggs

      ----bletlach: (crepes----
1/4 teaspoon salt
2 cup flour
1 cup water
3  egg
      ----filling----
1 lb cottage cheese
1 egg yolk
1 tablespoon sugar

sift  flour  and salt.   beat eggs well, add water. add flour
gradually to eggs, stirring constantly, until batter is smooth and
thin. heat a small frying pan, teflon makes life easy, and smear with
a very thin coat of butter.  when pan is hot, put in about 1/4 cup
batter, tilt pan until it covers.  cook until it begins to blister
and is shiny. turn out on table cloth. i always use one, but i guess
you can use paper towels. continue until all the batter is used.
should make 10 or 12 circles. mix the ingredients well. now it's time
to 'build your blintzas' as my daughter used to say. put some filling
off center on each circle. fold the bottom up and the top down.  tuck
in sides, or fold in, before you put the op down. confused? just try
it, it's easy. at this point you can store them in the fridge,  or
freeze them.  they freeze well. to finish, just fry them in a small
amount of butter, until browned great, served with sour cream. they
are a bit complicated, but not really difficult. howard, i am giving
you the recipe for 24 because it is so easy and they freeze so well.
use well seasoned pans, 6". this should make about 50 pancakes. i
guess the directions don't change when you change the ammounts.

breads

2 tablespoon yeast, dry
1 teaspoon diastatic malt powder
8 cup flour, all purpose
1 tablespoon salt
2 cup milk, skim
1/4 cup oil, vegetable
1/4 cup honey
2 large egg whites, lightly beaten

mix the yeast, diastatic malt powder, 6 cups flour, and the salt
together. in a saucepan heat the milk, vegetable oil, and honey to
120f. the liquid will just start to feel hot. pour the liquid into
the dry ingredients, and add the lightly beaten egg whites. add
another cup of flour and stir until the dough has formed a shaggy
mass. turn the dough out onto a lightly floured counter and knead the
dough, adding more flour as necessary, until the dough has formed a
smooth ball. place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, turning the
dough to coat with oil. cover the bowl with a damp towel. place the
dough in a warm spot and let rise until doubled in size. this will
take about l
1/2    hours.
punch the dough down and turn out onto a lightly floured counter.
knead the dough briefly to expel air bubbles. grease two 8 1/2" x 4
1/2" loaf pans. divide the dough into two pieces and roll each piece
out into a rectangle the same length as the pans. the rectangles
should be about 1/4" thick. roll up the dough the long way and place
it in the pans. cover the loaves with a damp towel and let them rise
30-45 minutes, until they are about 1" over the top of the pans.
while the loaves are rising, preheat the oven to 375f. bake the
loaves for 35-34 minutes, or until well browned and the bottoms sound
hollow when thumped. cool the loaves on a rack. yield: two loaves,
each yielding sixteen 1/2 inch slices.

cracked wheat bread (cannon)

breads

2 cup warm milk
1 cup wheat bran cereal (all-bran, fiber; 1, or 100% bran)
1/2 cup warm water
2 tablespoon yeast
1/3 cup honey
2 tablespoon olive oil or vegetable oil
2 teaspoon salt
1/2 cup cracked wheat
3 cup whole wheat flour
2 1/2 cup to 3 1/2 c bread flour (or all purp; ose flour)

in a large bowl, add wheat bran cereal to milk and soak 15-30 minutes.
proof yeast in warm water.

add yeast mixture, honey, olive oil, salt, and cracked wheat to milk
mixture and mix well. add the whole wheat flour, one cup at a time,
mixing well after each addition. then add bread flour 1/2 c at a
time, mixing well after each addition. when dough gets very stiff,
turn out onto a well-floured surface and knead in enough remaining
flour to make a good soft dough.

place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let
rise until doubled. punch down, divide in half, and form each half
into a loaf and place in a 8.5x4.5 inch or 9x5 inch bread pan and
cover. let rise until doubled in bulk.

bake in a preheated 375 degree oven for 30 minutes, remove from pans
and continue to bake for another 10-15 minutes until bread sounds
hollow on bottom. may need to cover tops with aluminum foil during
final 10-15 minutes of baking if top is browning too much. let cool
on racks before slicing.

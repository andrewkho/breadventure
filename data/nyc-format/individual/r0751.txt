make hard dough by kneading flour and egg about 5 minutes; let rest 15
minutes.  cut dough into 6 pieces; roll each to finger thickness (
will get about 6" length from each). bring 4 quarts water with 1
tbsp. salt to boil; sprinkle a little four on dough; pinch off little
pieces; drop into boiling water. use thumb and index fingers to pinch
off pieces. boil dumplings till they surface, then sample one to make
sure it is cooked through. note: you may drop the csipetke directly
into goulash soup, bean soup, or any other soup you use it for.

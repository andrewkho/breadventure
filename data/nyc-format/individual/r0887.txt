english crumpets (bakestone recipes)

breads, breakfast

4 oz all-purpose flour
4 oz bread flour
2 teaspoon salt
1/4 oz fresh yeast
1 teaspoon sugar
1/2 pint warm milk and water
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1/2 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda
1/4 pint warm water

sift the flours and salt into a warm bowl.  cream the yeast with the
sugar. add the warmed milk and water, then the oil.  stir into the
flour to make a batter, and beat vigorously until smooth and elastic.
cover the bowl, put in a warm place and leave it until the mixture
rises and the surface is full of bubbles (about 1 1/2 hours).  break
it down by beating with a wooden spoon.  cover and leave in a warm
place to prove for another 30 minutes.  -- to cook the crumpets, heat
and grease the bakestone lightly. grease 5 or 6 crumpet rings (3-3
1/2 inches) (or scone cutters) and put them on the bakestone to heat.
cook as many crumpets as possible at a time, as the batter will not
stay bubbly for long.   -- put 1/2 inch deep of batter into each
ring.  cook gently for 7 - 10 minutes, or until the surface sets and
is full of tiny bubbles.  using an oven glove for protection, lift
off the ring, and if the base of the crumpet is pale gold, flip it
over and cook for another 3 minutes until the other side is just
colored.  if the crumpet batter is set but sticks slightly in the
ring, push it out gently with the back of a wooden spoon.  wipe,
grease and heat the rings for each batch of crumpets.  if serving
immediately, wrap the crumpets in a cloth and keep warm between
batches.  butter generously and serve at once.  if reheating, toast
the crumpets under the grill, cooking the smooth surface first and
then the top so that the butter will melt into the holes.

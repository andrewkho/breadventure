1 tablespoon active dry yeast
1/4 cup warm water
2 tablespoon ground coriander
1 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/2 teaspoon white pepper
1 teaspoon ground fenugreek
2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup vegetable oil
1 1/4 cup lukewarm water
5 cup unbleached flour
1 tablespoon cayenne
2 tablespoon oil
1/4 teaspoon ground ginger
1 pinch ground cloves
1/8 teaspoon cinnamon

dissolve the yeast in warm water for 10 minutes. add the coriander,
cinnamon, white pepper, fenugreek, salt, oil and lukewarm water, and
stir well. slowly add the flour until a mass forms. on a floured
board, knead the dough for 10 minutes or until it is smooth and tiny
bubbles form. (note: this recipe makes a stickier dough than usual)

reserve a 1-inch piece of dough. with floured hands spread the dough
out on an ungreased pizza pan. using a sharp knife, score the dough
in a design similar to the spokes of a bicycle wheel. place the
reserved ball of dough in the center of the scored dough. cover and
let rise one hour.

bake at 350f  for an hour or until golden brown. combine the topping
ingredients in a small bowl. while still warm brush the bread with
topping. yield: 1 16-inch loaf.

churek / flat armenian bread with sesame seed

breads, dumplings

1 pkg dry yeast
1 tablespoon sugar
2 1/4 cup water -- lukewarm
6 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 lb unsalted butter -- melted
1 tablespoon salt
2 tablespoon white sesame seeds

sprinkle the yeast and 1 teaspoon of the sugar into 1/2 cup of
lukewarm (110-115f) water in a small, shallow bowl. let stand for 2
or 3 minutes, then stir to dissolve the yeast completely. set the
bowl aside in a warm, draft-free spot (such as an unlighted oven) for
about 5 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture almost doubles in volume.

pour the flour into a large mixing bowl and make a well in the
center. pour in the yeast mixture, remaining water, remaining sugar
and salt. with a large spoon beat the flour into the liquid
ingredients, continuing to beat for as long as 10 minutes, or until a
soft, spongy dough is formed. cover loosely with a kitchen towel and
set aside in the warm, draft-free spot until the mixture doubles in
volume.

preheat the oven to 350f.  place the dough on a lightly floured
surface and divide it into 10 equal parts. roll each part out as
thinly as possible into circles, then place 2 or 3 circles on a
cookie sheet. sprinkle lightly with cold water and a few sesame seeds
and set the cookie sheet on the floor of the oven. bake for 20
minutes, or until the bread is a pale golden brown.  transfer the
breads with a wide spatula to a wire cake rack and bake the remaining
rounds similarly. the bread will keep several days at room
temperature if wrapped securely in foil.

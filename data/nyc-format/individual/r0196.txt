breads

3 cup sifted enriched flour
3/4 cup sugar
3 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 1/2 teaspoon salt
1  egg, beaten
1 1/2 cup milk
2 tablespoon salad oil
3/4 cup california walnuts, broken

stir the dry ingredients together. combine egg, milk, and salad oil;
add to dry ingredients, mixing well. stir in nuts. turn into greased
9 1/2 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan. bake at 350f about an hour. remove from
pan; cool.

note: i usually put in 1 c nuts. don't over mix because it won't
rise, and becomes a hard brick.

it's especially good with cream cheese spread on it.

recipe from better homes & gardens approx. early 1960s.

1/2 cup all-bran cereal
2 to 2 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
1 1/2 cup rye flour

makes 2 loaves

sprinkle yeast and sugar over 1/4 cup water; stir to dissolve. let
stand until foamy, about 10 minutes.

melt chocolate and margarine with 1 1/4 cups water in large bowl set
over gently simmering water.  stir until smooth. remove from over
water. blend in molasses, vinegar and salt. mix in cereal. let cool.

grease large bowl.  blend yeast into cereal mixture. gradually stir
in 2 cups all-purpose flour and rye flour. turn dough out onto
lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 10
minutes, kneading in up to 3/4 cup more all-purpose flour if
necessary to form workable dough. add dough to prepared bowl, turning
to coat entire surface. cover and let rise in warm draft-free area
until doubled in volume, about 2 hours.

grease two 3x2x7-inch loaf pans.  punch dough down. turn out onto
lightly floured surface and let rest 3 minutes. knead 3 minutes.
divide dough in half.  roll each into 7x8-inch rectangle. starting
with long side, roll dough up into cylinder. tuck ends under and
pinch seam to seal. place seam side down in prepared pans. cover and
let rise in warm draft-free area until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.

preheat oven to 375 f.  bake until loaves sound hollow when tapped on
bottom, about 45 minutes.  remove bread from pans. let cool
completely on rack before serving.

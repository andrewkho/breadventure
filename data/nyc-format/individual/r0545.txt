fit processor with steel blade. measure flour, butter, remaining
sugar and salt into work bowl.  process until mixed, about 15
seconds. turn on processor and very slowly drizzle just enough
remaining water through feed tube into flour mixture so dough forms a
ball that cleans the sides of the bowl. process until ball turns
around bowl about 25 times. turn off processor and let dough stand 1
to 2 minutes. turn on processor and gradually drizzle in enough
remaining water to make dough soft, smooth and satiny, but not
sticky.  process until dough turns around bowl about 15 times. turn
dough onto lightly greased surface.  cover with inverted bowl and let
stand 20 minutes. prepare cinnamon sugar while dough is standing.
roll out dough into a 9 x 15-inch rectangle.  cut into three 3 x
15-inch strips. spoon 1/3 of cinnamon sugar lengthwise down center of
each strip. pull one edge of each strip over cinnamon sugar to meet
other edge of same strip. pinch seam to seal. braid the strips
together to form a loaf. tuck ends under and pinch to seal.  place
braid on greased cookie sheet. brush with beaten egg white and
sprinkle with almonds. let stand in warm place until doubled, about 1
hour. heat oven to 375 f.  bake until evenly brown and loaf sounds
hollow when tapped, 30 - 35 minutes. remove from cookie sheet and
cool on wire rack. i use only 1 tbs of sugar for the dough and the
brown sugar substitute for the filling...great for

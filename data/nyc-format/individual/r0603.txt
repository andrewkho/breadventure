corn bread (barry)

breads, barry

14 oz strong plain flour
10 oz medium yellow corn meal not corn fl; our
2 tablespoon sugar
2 tablespoon baking powder
8 fl oz milk
4 tablespoon sunflower or soya oil
2 tablespoon natural yoghurt
      ----optional----
8 oz grated cheddar cheese

grease a 2 pound loaf tin and heat the oven to gas mark 5,375f,190c.
place the flour, corn meal, sugar and baking powder into a bowl, and
beat in the eggs, milk, oil and yoghurt. mix all the liquids together
first if you like, then pour them in. give the mixture a good stir.
at this point you could add 8 ounces of grated cheddar cheese or
similar. pour into the tin and bake for 55 minutes. test with a
skewer - if it comes out clean it's ready, if it's a bit smeary it
needs another 5 to 10 minutes, but cover the top with foil to stop
the crust burning. remove when ready and let it stand for five
minutes before turning out. you may find a knife round the edge helps

christmas stollen from brigitte sealing

breads, christmas

1 1/8 lb flour
7 oz sugar
1 pinch salt
1 teaspoon vanilla
1 teaspoon lemon juice
4 tablespoon rum
1 pinch cardomom (generous)
1 pinch mace (generous)
2  eggs
4 1/2 oz butter
4 1/2 oz currants well drained
9 oz sultanas
9 oz almonds, finely chopped
3 1/2 oz candied lemon peel
1 3/4 oz butter for brushing
2 tablespoon powdered sugar for dusting
1 3/4 oz beef drippings
9 oz cottage cheese, well drained

mix and sieve together the flour and baking powder onto a pastry
board or cool slab. make a well in the center and pour in the sugar,
vanilla, rum, lemon juice, and the eggs. draw in some flour from the
sides of the well to mix with these and form a thick paste. add the
cold butter, cut into small pieces, the finely chopped beef
drippings, cottage cheese, currants, sultanas, nuts and candied peel.
cover the fruits with more of the flour, and then starting from the
middle, work all of it together quickly with your hands into a firm,
smooth paste. if it should stick, add a little more flour. form the
mix into a long, oval shape, and then fold it over lengthwise to give
it the traditional "stollen" shape.

line a baking dish with greased waxed paper and place stollen on this.

preheat the oven for 5 minutes at 500f. then bake at a moderately hot
over (375f) for 50-60 minutes. as soon as the stollen comes out of
the oven, brush with melted butter and dust thickly with powdered
sugar.

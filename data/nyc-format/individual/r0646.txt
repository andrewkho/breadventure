cornmeal crepes with berries

breads

3 cup sliced strawberries
2 tablespoon sugar
1 cup milk
3  large eggs
2/3 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup yellow cornmeal
1 teaspoon vanilla
2 1/2 teaspoon butter or margarine
1/4 cup apricot jam
1  vanilla low-fat yogurt*

* - or regular sour cream

mix strawberries and sugar; set aside. in a blender, whirl milk, eggs,
flour, cornmeal, and vanilla until there are no lumps.

place a flat-bottom 7-8"-wide frying or crepe pan over medium-high
heat. when pan is hot, add 1/4 teaspoon butter and swirl to coat
surface. pour in 1/4 cup batter all at once; quickly tilt pan so
batter flows over entire surface (don't worry if there are a few
holes). cook until surface is dry and edge is lightly browned, about
1 minute. turn with a spatula and brown other side. turn out onto a
plate; keep warm. repeat to cook remainder, stirring batter
thoroughly before cooking each crepe (cornmeal sinks), and stacking
crepes as made.

spread 1 side of each crepe lightly with jam; fold in quarters. offer
crepes with berries and yogurt to add to taste.

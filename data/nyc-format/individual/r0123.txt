bara brith ( speckled bread)

breads, ethnic

6 oz dried fruit
8 oz dark brown sugar
1/2 pint strong hot tea
10 oz self-raising flour
1  egg

this is wales' traditional rich fruit bread.  south wales makes it
with baking powder; northerners prefer yeast as the raising agent.
either way it's delicious.

soak the dried fruit and sugar overnight in the tea. you can use
either fresh tea, or the cold dregs from the teapot (this gives a
good strong colour).  next day, sieve the flour and fold it it into
the fruit. mix in the lightly beaten egg.  line a small loaf-tin with
buttered paper then tip in the mixture, smoothing it well into the
corners.

bake in a gentle oven at 300 f (150 c) gas mark 2 for 1 1/2 hours.
cool and store for at least 2 days in a tin so that it matures moist
and rich. traditionalists say you should never butter the bara brith,
but dorothy says do, as it's lovely that way.

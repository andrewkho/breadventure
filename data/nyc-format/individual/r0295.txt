breads

1 pizza dough of choice
1/2 stick margerine
1 garlic powder
1 parmesean cheese

after making the dough for your pizza you place it on a piece of
heavy duty aluminium foil. spread it into a circular pizza shape.
take your pizza cutter and score the dough into 1/2" slices and then
cut the entire pie in half.  melt a 1/2 stick of margerine and add
1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder(add more or less to suit you). spread
this on your bread sticks. top the bread with parmesean cheese and
place aluminum foil directly on oven rack-no pan needed-at 450
degrees until crispy and browned. i always make an extra crust when
making pizza for my family. after eating the bread sticks no one
wants much pizza. i hope you like it. mary in memphis

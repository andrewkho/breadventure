breads

2 cup bisquick
2/3 cup milk
1/2 cup grated cheddar cheese
1/4 cup butter; melted
1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1 dash italian seasoning; generous

combine first 3 ingredients.  it will be sticky. spoon into 12
well-greased muffin tins.  do not use paper liners. combine last 3
ingredients and spread evenly over the raw batter. bake for about
10-15 minutes at
450    until nicely browned. lobster does. we had some the other
evening when we went to red lobster for dinner, and i know how
addictive they are.  we had 2 left over in our bread basket; i took
them home and nibbled on them cold later that night while i played on
the *p board. i have not tried these myself, >>> but when this recipe
was posted, the poster said they taste just like the ones red lobster
makes. good luck with them. i would love to know how they turn out!

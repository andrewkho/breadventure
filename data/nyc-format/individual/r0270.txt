bran muffin mix

breads, cakes

1 cup unprocessed coarse bran
2 cup whole wheat flour
1 cup all-purpose flour
1/4 cup sugar (or more to taste)
2 tablespoon baking powder
2 teaspoon salt

whisk all ingredients together in lge. bowl--mix thoroughly. measure
2 cups into each of 2 plastic bags. divide any remaining mix equally.

this mix does not produce a sweet cake-like muffin. rather full
bodied and textured.  this produces nice contrast when heaped with
orange marmalade.

however, feel free to adjust sugar to taste.  these recipes are meant
to serve only as guidelines.  tinker with them to your hearts'
delight. they are all "cook-friendly", for the exception of any yeast
raised mixes, which must be handled like one would approach a prima
donna: with respect. yeast breads are quite tempermental.

yield: 1 servings

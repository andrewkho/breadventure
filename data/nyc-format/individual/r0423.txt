warm (about 125f) and stir in dry ingredients. mix in enough reserved

lightly floured surface until smooth and elastic, about 8 minutes.
cover and let rest on floured surface
10    minutes.

divide dough into 16 equal pieces. roll each piece into 20 inch
rope. on lightly greased baking sheets, shape into pretzels; curve
ends of each rope to make circle, cross ends at top, twist ends once
and lay over bottom of each circle. cover and let rise in warm,
draft-free place 15 minutes.

brush tops with water and sprinkle with coarse salt and sesame or
poppy seeds, if desired.

bake in preheated 375f oven 12 to 15 minutes or until golden. remove
pretzels to cooling racks.

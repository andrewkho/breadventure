1  day old bread

cut bread into small squares - any size will do. spread in a baking
pan and add your favorite herbs and spices. bake at 200 to 225 for up
to 2 hours. after every 30 minutes, give them a stir and poke with a
fork to see whether they are done to your liking. they will turn a
golden brown and taste yummy. low fat - low calorie - and delicious.
what more could we ask for ? regards, ^^ gaye in bellevue, wa ^^

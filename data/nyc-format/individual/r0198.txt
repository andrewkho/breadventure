biscuit tips:

1. when measuring large quantities of dry ingredients, measure each
into separate bowl; that way, if you lose count, you can recheck
measure before mixing ingredients.

2. always pour liquid ingredients over the entire surface of the dry
ingredients, meanwhile tossing lightly with fork to incorporate dry
ingredients into wet without overworking the flour.

3. dip cutter into flour between cutting each biscuit to prevent
dough from sticking to cutter.

4. any scraps left over after cutting dough can be sprinkled with
sugar, then baked. or, to avoid wastage, pat dough into a square,
then cut into squares instead of rounds.

5. because biscuits are rich in fat, you don't need to grease the
baking sheet. you can leave the sheet ungreased or sprinkle baking
sheet lightly with all-purpose flour.

6. to ensure even browning and baking, make each biscuit the same
size and shape.

7. to remove sticky batter from bowl and fork, first rinse with cold
water before washing in hot soapy water.

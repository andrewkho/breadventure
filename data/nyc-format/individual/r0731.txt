2 tablespoon good olive oil
1 medium onion, chopped
2  ribs celery, chopped
1 small carrot, grated

1  grated fontina cheese

in a large sauce pan heat oil and saute chopped veggies until lightly
browned, about 7 minutes.  add lentils and broth and bring to a boil.
reduce heat and add basil, salt, pepper and bay leaf. simmer until
lentils are very soft, about 50 minutes. remove the bay leaf and
puree in a food processor until very smooth. let cool to room temp.
mound on lightly toasted italian bread and sprinkle with fontina (if
you want a little color, a strip of roasted red pepper looks good).
run under a preheated broiler until cheese is melted and bubbly. the
lentil puree keeps well, bring to room temp if refrigerated.

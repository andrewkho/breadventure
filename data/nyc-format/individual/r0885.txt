emeril's sourdough starter

breads

1 cup unbleached flour, plus more
1  for feeding
1/2 cup whole grain rye flour
1 cup bottled still water, plus
1  more for feeding

in a large glass bowl stir flours and water together with a spoon.
cover with a kitchen towel. set aside to ferment at room temp for 2
to 3 days. it will begin to smell sour, but not in an unpleasant way.
stir in 2/3 cup flour and 1/2 cup water, cover and continue to
ferment at room temp. refresh starter in this way every day for 3
days. it will become sharper and more pungent as it sits. when it is
sharp enough for you, begin using it to bake with. after using the
amount of starter you need, the remaining starter should be
refrigerated. let it come to room temp each time you use it.

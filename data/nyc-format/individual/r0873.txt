recipe by: edinburgh tearoom, edinburgh scones
heat oven to 425~.  sift dry ingredients together. cut in butter.
add raisins or currents.  mix buttermilk and egg together. add all at
once to flour. mix with fork just until mixture clings together. form
into ball, turn out on floured surface and knead gently until smooth,
not more than 5 turns of the dough. pat out til 1/2 inch thick and
cut with a 2" cutter. place on baking sheet 1 inch apart. brush tops
lightly with milk and sprinkle with sugar. bake 10 minutes until
golden brown. serve with lemon curd. lemon curd
beat eggs in top of double boiler. stir in remaining ingredients.
cook over simmering water 30 minutes, stirring frequently until thick
and smooth. (i do not use a double boiler, but use a low heat and
watch closely to prevent burning). when it has thickened, remove from
heat. it will thicken more when cooled. cool, cover and refrigerate.
keeps 2 to 3 weeks in refrigerator. this has become a holiday
breakfast tradition for our family and i give small jars of the lemon
curd as gifts along with the scone recipe for friends who bake.

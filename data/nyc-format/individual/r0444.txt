cheese scones

beverages, breads, cheese

1 cup all-purpose flour
1 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
1 teaspoon dry mustard
1 pinch salt
1 cup whole-wheat flour
3 teaspoon cold butter or margarine, cut in sm; all pieces
3/4 cup (3oz) finely shredded sharp cheddar; cheese
2/3 cup milk (about)
1  butter

this qualifies as a savory; a bit of a change from the usual scone.

preheat oven to 425f (220c).  lightly grease a large baking sheet; set
aside.  sift all-purpose flour, baking powder, dry mustard and salt
into a large bowl. stir in the whole-wheat flour. with your fingers,
rub in cold butter until mixture is crumbly.  stir in 1/2 cup cheese.
make a well in center of mixture; add milk and mix with a fork to
make a dough that barely holds together (you may need to press dough
together with your hands). turn out onto floured surface and knead
lightly. roll out with a floured rolling pin or pat dough with your
hands to make a round about 3/4-inch thick. cut into rounds with a
2-inch fluted or plain cookie cutter. place 1 to 1 1/2 inches apart
on baking sheet; sprinkle with remaining 1/4 cup cheese. bake 8-10
minutes or until well risen and golden. transfer to a wire rack to
cool.  when cold, split and serve with butter. makes about 12 scones.

dried tart cheery scones

breads

3 cup + 3 t flour
6 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
10 teaspoon milk
1/2 cup dried tart cherries; cut up
1/2 cup sugar
1/2 cup chilled butter; cut up
1  egg; beaten
1 teaspoon orange or lemon rind; grated

preheat oven to 350.  lightly grease baking sheet. stir together the
flour, sugar and baking powder. cut in butter until mixture resembles
crumbs. (a food processor works great.) stir in dried cherries and
grated rind. combine milk and egg. mix into dry ingredients, gather
dough into a ball. roll dough out 1/2" thick onto a lightly floured
surface. cut into 3" circles with a sharp knife or biscuit cutter. (a
glass does not work well because it crimps the edges and they will
not rise as well.) arrange on a baking sheet, 1" apart. bake until
firm to touch, about 20 minutes. serve warm. from: american spoon

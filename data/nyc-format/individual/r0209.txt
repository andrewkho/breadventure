biga di grano duro (durum flour biga)

breads, italian, bakery

1/2 teaspoon dried yeast
1/4 cup warm water
1 cup water at room temperature
2 1/4 cup golden durum flour

stir the yeast into the warm water in a large bowl & let proof for 10
minutes.  add the rest of the water & the flour 1 c at a time, mixing
vigorously after each addition. continue to mix for about 6 minutes.
the mixture will clear the sides of the bowl but remain soft &
sticky. cover with plastic wrap & leave to rise at room temperature
for 24 hours. the starter will triple in volume & then collapse a
little. cover & refrigerate until ready to use. to use the biga,
scoop out the needed amount while it is still cold & hasn't begun to
grow & expand at room temperature. note: ensure that you use golden
durum flour & not durum integrale which contains the whole husk of
the wheat berry & is not right for this recipe.

yield: 2 cups

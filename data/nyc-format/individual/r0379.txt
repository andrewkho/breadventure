3 pkg yeast
1 1/3 cup warm water (110-115)
1 tablespoon granulated sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoon softened butter/margerine
3 each large eggs lightly beaten
6 cup unleached white flour
1 each egg, well beaten
1 single with 1 tablespoon water (a w
1 single poppy seeds

add 1 tablespoon sugar and yeast to warm water, stir well and "proof"
the yeast (i'm old-fashioned and still do this). after the yeast
proofs, add rest of the sugar, butter/margerine, 3 lightly beaten
eggs, and five cups flour.  as your stir together, add salt (done
this way because salt can kill yeast if added directly). beat
ingredients with a spoon, gradually adding flour, until dough is
stiff.  knead on board until dough is smooth and elastic (8-10mins).
cover and let rise in warm place -- until about doubled in size
(1.5-2hrs).
punch down and knead dough until all the bubbles are gone. divide
into 6 parts, roll each part between your hands into a rope about 1"
in diameter. braid 3 ropes each into 2 loaves. place two braids about
6" apart on a buttered/margerined cookie sheet, and allow to raise in
a warm place until almost doubled in size. brush tops with egg/water
wash and sprinkle lightly with poppy seeds.  bake in pre-heated 400
oven for 35-40 mins, or until loaves sound hollow when tapped. cool
covered with a soft towel on racks.

cheese bread (libum)

breads

1 cup feta cheese, drained,
1  crumbled, and packed into
1  the measuring cup
1/2 cup unbleached, all-purpose
1  flour
1  egg, beaten
6  bay leaves
2 tablespoon honey

1) put the cheese into a medium sized mixing bowl. mash well with
the fingers until it becomes a smooth, lumpless paste. add the flour
and mix well with the fingers. add the beaten egg and mix well. the
dough will be rather sticky.

2) divide the dough into two equal parts, then form two round,
flat, 1/2 inch thick loaves.  lay each on three bay leaves set on a
greased baking sheet, and bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 1
to 1-1/2 hours, or until cooked through.

3) remove the loaves from the oven, spread the tops with the
honey, and let cool.  remove the bay leaves before serving. note: if
feta cheese is unavailable, use 1 cup cottage cheese and add 1/4 cup
extra flour (but the taste is inferior).

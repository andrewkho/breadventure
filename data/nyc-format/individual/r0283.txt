bread fat substitute - applesauce

breads

1  no ingredients

try substituting unsweetened applesauce for the fats called for in
your bread recipes. this even works with chocolate cake! many can't
tell any difference in taste and the pectin in the applesauce keeps
the bread moist longer. i buy the small motts individual containers
so i don't have a large jar going bad in the fridge. i've read that
you can use up to one tablespoon of applesauce per cup of flour. if
you do make this substitution hold out about 1/8 to 1/4 cup of the
liquid in the recipe and add it back in a tsp. at a time during the
kneading cycle.

buurebrot / swiss half-rye bread

breads

150 gm rye flour
850 gm strong white flour
3 cup water
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon dry yeast

("strong white" flour is the uk term for all-purpose flour.) mix the
yeast in 1/2 c of the water at blood heat, and leave 15 minutes to
proof. sift the mixed wheat and rye flours into a mixing bowl to
warm. when the yeast has proofed, make a well in the flour, pour the
yeast mixture in, and cover it over with a little flour. leave for 20
minutes to "set the sponge". when this time has elapsed, begin mixing
(or kneading with the dough hook if using a mixer). add 2 cups of the
water, check for texture, and add the rest if necessary. knead
vigorously. if using a dough hook, somewhere about 10 minutes into
the process the dough will suddenly change texture and require more
flour. add it (probably about another 150 g). turn the dough into an
oiled bowl to rise. the texture will be somewhat sticky. after
allowing to rise for 1-1&1/2 hours, turn out of the bowl, punch down,
and divide into two loaves. turn into nonstick pans (or greased ones)
and allow to rise for another hour. bake at 220c for 35 minutes. turn
out of the pans and allow to sit in the still-hot oven upside down
for 5 minutes to harden the crusts. let sit overnight before cutting.

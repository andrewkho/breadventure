cracker barrel biscuits

breads, pasta, salsa

1  waldine van geffen
      vghc42a-----
2 cup bisquick
2/3 cup real buttermilk

work together bisquick and buttermilk to smooth dough. dip hand in
just enough bisquick to kneed dough in bowl until smooth and elastic.
shape dough into 16 thin patties, placing1 atop another forming 8
biscuits in greased 9" round baking pan. bake at 450~ 16 to 18
minutes or until golden. wipe tops at once in butter. they split
easily because of the way you formed them with the 2 pieces. to make
bonanza copycats, add 4 ts sugar. shape into 6 patties, 1" thick, 3"
round. place close together in greased round baking pan. wipetops in
soft butter. bake 450~ 18 minutes or until brown. cool 10 minutes
before serving. split with thumbs instead of cutting with knife.
these do not keep well. right out of oven wipe tops again with dabs
more butter to keep surface soft and tender. source: gloria pitzer's

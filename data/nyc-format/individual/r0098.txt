banana flour

breads

6 ripe bananas

slice and dry full grown bananas. use only the fruit that is full
grown as green bananas contain too much starch. after drying, grind
or pound in a mortar, then pass the powder through a sieve. this
flour can be used in equal parts with regular flour in making
desserts where a starchy substance is used.

asparagus breadsticks

appetizers, breads

2  bread dough loaves*
1  large egg white
1/4 cup grated parmesan cheese
1 teaspoon dried tarragon leaves
1 teaspoon dried dill weed

* - frozen white or whole wheat, thawed

set loaves on a floured board and pat each loaf into a 5x10"
rectangle. cover lightly with plastic wrap and let rinse until puffy,
45 minutes to 1 hour.

cut each loaf crosswise into 9 equal pieces. pick up the ends of each
piece, and stretch it to the length of a 12x15" greased baking sheet
and set on pan; if dough snaps back, let rest a few minutes, then
stretch again. repeat to make each stick, spacing about 1 1/2" apart.

with scissors at a 45' angle, snip dough to make cuts about 1/2" apart
along about 4" of 1 end of each stick.

beat egg white until slightly frothy; brush dough lightly with egg
white. mix cheese, tarragon, and dill. sprinkle evenly over dough.

bake in a 350' oven until breadsticks are browned, 20-25 minutes. (if
using 1 oven, switch pan positions halfway through baking; chill
remaining pans of dough until oven is free.) transfer breadsticks to
racks.

serve warm or cool. if you make sticks ahead, let cool, package
airtight, and hold up to 4 hours, or freeze. to recrisp, bake
breadsticks (thawed, if frozen), uncovered, on pans in a 350' oven
until warm, about 5 minutes.

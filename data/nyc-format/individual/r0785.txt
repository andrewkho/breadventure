2 teaspoon onion powder

in large mixer bowl, combine 1 cup all purpose flour, 1 cup rye flour,
yeast, bran cereal, salt, caraway seed and onion powder; mix well. in
saucepan, heat milk, 1/2 cup water, molasses, oil and chocolate until
very warm (125-130 degrees; chocolate does not need to melt). add to
flour mixture. blend at low speed until moistened; beat 3 minutes at
medium speed.

by hand, gradually stir in remaining rye flour and enough remaining
all purpose flour to make a firm dough. knead on floured surface
until smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes. place in greased bowl,
turning to grease top.

cover, let rise in warm place until double, 30-45 minutes. punch down
dough.

divide into 2 parts. on lightly floured surface, shape each half into
a round loaf. place in greased 8 inch layer cake pans. cover; let
rise in warm place until almost doubled, about 15 minutes. bake at
375 degrees for 40-45 minutes. combine 1/4 cup water and cornstarch
for glaze in small saucepan; heat to boiling. brush on loaves 5
minutes before end of baking. sprinkle caraway seeds on loaves, if
desired. return loaves to oven for 5 minutes or until glaze is glossy
and loaves sound hollow when tapped. remove from pans when cool.

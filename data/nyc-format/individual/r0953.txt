if you haven't tried flame-toasted wheat tortillas you're in for a
treat. like toast they can be topped in endless ways.

place a tortilla directly over a medium high gas flame, or place on a
cookie rack set over an electric burner. toast until surface becomes
lightly flecked with char, about 10 to 20 seconds, and tortilla
begins to fill with steam.  turn over and toast the other side. a
perfect tortilla will fill with steam and puff up if it has no tears
or holes.

if desired, brush tortilla with oil or butter.  place in a towel-lined
basket while toasting the remaining pieces. serve piping hot.

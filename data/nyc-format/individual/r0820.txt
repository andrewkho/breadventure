dough for regular crust pizza

breads

4 cup all-purpose flour
1  cake yeast
1 1/3 cup warm water
2 tablespoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt
1 teaspoon parmesan, grated
1  cornmeal

preheat the oven to 400 degrees. place the pizza baking stone(s) or
tile(s) in the oven to be heated. dissolve the yeast in the warm (85
degrees f) water. let stand without stirring until the mixture foams
(8-10 minutes). combine the flour and salt in a bowl. add the olive
oil and yeast mixture. stir well. add the grated parmesan. stir well.
cover the bowl with a cloth. let the dough rest about 10 minutes.
turn out onto a well floured board and knead until smooth (about 10
minutes). place the dough in a greased bowl. cover and let rise until
doubled (about 2 hours). punch down. turn out onto a floured board.
divide the dough into equal portions. roll each portion of the dough
to a thickness of 1/4 ". oil the (14") pizza pans. sprinkle some
cornmeal on each. form the pies in the pans, pinching the edges up a
little to hold the filling. brush the dough liberally with olive oil.
spread the sauce(s), seasoning(s) and topping(s) over the dough
leaving the outer 1/2" bare. let the pies rest about 10 minutes.
remove the pies from the pans and, using a pizza paddle, place on the
baking stone(s). bake until the edges are light brown and the cheese
is bubbly. serve.

cake doughnuts (crocker)

breads, crockpot

1  vegetable oil
3 1/3 cup all-purpose flour*
1 cup sugar
3/4 cup milk
2 tablespoon shortening
3 teaspoon baking powder
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg
2  eggs

heat oil (2 to 3 inches) in deep fryer or dutch oven to 375f beat 1.5
cups of the flour and the remaining ingredients in 1.5-quart bowl on
low speed, scraping bowl constantly, 30 seconds. beat on medium
speed, scraping bowl occasionally, 2 minutes. stir in remaining flour.

turn the dough onto generously floured cloth-covered board; roll
around lightly to coat with flour. gently roll 3/8 inch thick cut
with floured doughnut cutter. slide doughnuts into hot oil with wide
spatula. turn doughnuts as they rise to surface. fry until golden
brown, 1 to 1.5 minutes on each side. remove carefully from oil (do
not prick surfaces); drain. serve plain or shake one at a time in a
bag with powdered sugar. 2 dozen doughnuts;150 calories per doughnut.

*if using self rising flour; omit babng powder and salt.

buttermilk doughnuts: do not use self rising flour. substitute
buttermilk for the milk. decrease baking powder to 2 ts and beat in 1
ts baking soda.

note: hot fat cools somewhat when foods are dropped into it. while
foods are frying, temperature of fat should be 370f to 380f. if fat
is too hot, foods brown before they are cooked through; if too cool,
foods become grease-soaked. a deep-fat thermometer is a good
investment; checking it helps maintain a constant temperature. do not
use a candy thermometer for deep-fat fiying as it does not register
high enough.

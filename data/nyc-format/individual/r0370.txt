cascaron -- bitsu-bitsu (dough balls)

desserts, doughnuts, filipino

1 pkg mochi flour
1  coconut; grated, place coconut in
1 1/2 cup hot water; pour into bowl of coconut
1/3  box of dark brown sugar
1/4 cup cold water

squeeze grated coconut in water than strain coconut water in clean
dish towel over another bowl.  squeeze until all liquid has been
extracted. (instead of fresh coconut, you may use 1/2 can of grated
coconut and 1
1/2    cups of water.)
place canned coconut in flour and add water until dough is soft
but not too sticky.  do the same with fresh coconut. shape dough in
balls of 1 inch diameter and fry in deep fat until golden brown.
drain dough balls on paper towel.  then put them in a large mixing
bowl.
when all have been fried, boil water and brown sugar in a small
sauce pan until it reaches the soft boil stage. this is done by
placing a drop of syrup in a bowl of cold water. if it retains it
shape and is soft, it is ready.  pour over dough balls.  mix well so
that all are coated with syrup. remove from bowl and place them in a
platter to cool. excellent with coffee or tea.

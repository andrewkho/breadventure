# Breadventure

The idea in this project was to try and train some NLP models to generate Bread recipes and see what kind of nonsense you get.

Originally I started this in 2018 and used LSTM's. It did better than I thought it would. Everything was trained on my old desktop computer with a 3GB Graphics card. 

Oct 2021, I've learned just a little bit more now, and wanted to try again with some of the pre-trained Transformer models, to see how it does. It's so much easier now. I thankfully kept the small amount of training data I had, around a couple thousand recipes, and used HuggingFace Transformer models.

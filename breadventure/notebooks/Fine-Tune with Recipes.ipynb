      "    Black Friday — the day after Thanksgiving — is equal parts shopping and leftovers. Turkey sandwiches are a must; but what do you do with all those leftover bits of stuffing, mashed potatoes, squash, creamed onions... Well, kill two birds with one stone: make a delicious sandwich loaf, AND use those other leftovers from the Turkey Day meal right in the bread itself. This moist, flavorful bread slices beautifully; and when you use stuffing as one of the ingredients, its mild herb flavor is perfect for a turkey sandwich.\n",
      "    \n",
      "       113g King Arthur White Whole Wheat Flour 298g King Arthur Unbleached Bread Flour 28g soft butter 1 to 1 1/4 teaspoons salt, to taste 14g sugar 2 1/2 teaspoons instant yeast 152g lukewarm milk 128g prepared stuffing 213g mashed potatoes, white or sweet \n",
      "    \n",
      "     Directions   Place all of the ingredients in a bowl (or the bowl of your stand mixer; or a bread machine bucket); and mix and knead to make a smooth, elastic, and somewhat sticky dough. The dough will feel tacky, but should hold its shape nicely; you should be able to handle it easily with greased hands.  Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl or 8-cup measure (for easiest tracking of the dough as it rises). Allow it to rise until it's quite puffy, 1 1/2 to 2 hours.  Gently deflate the dough. Shape it into an 11\" to 12\" log, and place it on a parchment-lined or lightly greased baking sheet.  Cover the loaf with lightly greased plastic wrap or a dough cover (the plastic cover of a disposable supermarket deli tray or cake platter may work well for you here), and let the loaf rise until it's noticeably puffy, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Towards the end of the rising time, preheat the oven to 350°F.   Bake the bread for 35 to 45 minutes, until it's golden brown on top, and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center registers at least 190°F.   Remove the bread from the oven, and place it on a rack to cool. When completely cool, wrap airtight and store at room temperature for 3 to 4 days; freeze for longer storage.  \n",

      "     Directions    Combine all of the ingredients (optional) in a medium-sized bowl, cover, and let stand for 45 to 90 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and elastic; add the egg yolks and 1 cup of the butter for the mixture, stirring just occasionally.  Stir in the melted butter, the melted butter, and the egg yolks.  Add the butter, egg yolks, and 1/2 cup of the cream or water yolks to mix the mixture.  Allow the mixture to rise for about 1 hour; at this point, the liquid and eggs will be dissolved.   Remove the bread from the bowl, and cool on a wire rack.    While the mixture is rising, preheat your oven to 350°F.   To make a sandwich: Preheat the oven to 400°F.  To make an ice-cream sandwich: Combine the frozen, melted butter, egg yolks and egg yolks.  Whisk in the melted butter, 1 cup of the cream, and the remaining butter. Stir the melted butter into the egg yolks and pour the melted butter into the sandwich.  Bake the sandwiches for 35 to 40 minutes, until they're light, and the center of the pan registers 190°F.  Remove the bread from the oven, turn it out onto a rack, and bake for 25 to 30 minutes.  Store at room temperature for 5 days, or freeze for up to 1 year, or freeze for up to 3 years.  \n",

      "        ---- The King of Spain (1926-2070) was an extremely successful country and one of its earliest settlers. He was a brilliant man, but at that time, his life was very sad.   He grew up on this island in the country where there was no church except for the mass, and even though no one wanted to go to a church for a mass, they thought it should bring together the people who loved the religion and the traditions of the day. During this time, he found it very difficult to imagine how we could take away all that he had; and instead he was looking for a place to go to celebrate the holiday. In many ways, it's the result of an effort he was hard at work at, striving to make it all the way to the conclusion he could.\n",
